In a few words Porthos	85.9126
Well said DArtagnan to Athos	433.1347
Yes yes replied he I	573.6666
But in either case what	62.3494
The fact is one can	531.3040
We must extricate ourselves from	94.2166
You must try to see	58.1272
Say to her Peace or	19.4065
My word as a gentleman	482.4399
If not I will apply	619.0089
The more we have ventured	835.1374
God has preserved us hitherto	141.5349
Besides we are men and	882.5218
What she asked Athos <PAD>	8.5275
Constance Madame Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD>	9.1698
Ah thats true said Athos	13.1513
My poor friend I had	485.1813

You say she is in	28.9678
Yes Very well <PAD> <PAD>	7.8509
As soon as the siege	1562.1978
But I think I have	16.2053

You <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8487

THE SIGN OF THE RED	5232.6821
Bassompierre and Schomberg against the	30.6858

Bassompierre and Schomberg were marshals	1199.5796
The result was that to	27.9116
Bassompierre and Schomberg from deserting	299.7022
Bassompierre took up his quarters	2453.1077
The quarters of Monsieur were	1909.7709
So that Monsieur watched Bassompierre	335.4928
As soon as this organization	437.3306
The juncture was favorable <PAD>	13.1121
The English who require above	3901.9875

An envoy of the Duke	1876.7588
This league was directed against	21.8442
Still further in Buckinghams lodging	2180.7388

It was upon the cardinal	546.3484
All therefore of the vast	840.2543
The cardinal was acquainted with	168.6803
If the league which threatened	164.1483
Spanish policy and Austrian policy	1629.2903
The king even while obeying	1479.7533
He would then be lost	37.0553
All this must be prepared	16.0552
Courtiers becoming every instant more	1169.0188
There were monks who wore	1548.0190
There were also less agreeable	1903.7091
It is true that the	591.9481
These attempts did not prevent	4636.2886
On their part the Musketeers	780.9417
This was the more easy	1069.4944
Now one evening when DArtagnan	699.3060
They immediately all three halted	236.8515
In an instant and as	683.9119
The hesitation created some suspicion	1220.1093
That is not an answer	17.2575
Who goes there <PAD> <PAD>	7.7280
Answer or we charge Beware	910.2708

Athos said the Musketeer <PAD>	9.2347
The cardinal made a sign	67.4605
These three Musketeers shall follow	76.6590
I am not willing it	678.5056
Thank God we can keep	619.1016
You have a quick ear	143.0766

Ah very well replied the	20.2508
You did well to defend	672.7151
Athos bowed <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5652
And now gentlemen thats well	30.1954
I know what I wish	1464.4921
They soon arrived at the	37.4198
No doubt the host knew	892.5458
Ten paces from the door	475.7526
A saddled horse was fastened	49.4156
The cardinal knocked three times	55.5011
A man enveloped in a	1235.2205

You have told me the	524.6921
In the meantime follow me	182.9524
The cardinal threw the bridle	784.2289
The host stood at the	14.5813
For him the cardinal was	85.7367

THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES It	7554.5977
Now who was that someone	10.5622
That was the question the	49.9204
Then seeing that none of	1146.7594
Porthos and Aramis placed themselves	62.8376
Athos walked about in a	32.7773
While thinking and walking Athos	2090.3320

Two men whom you will	222.5198

Now let us return to	444.2125
It was evident that the	668.1431

The two Musketeers who loved	510.6739
All three then sat down	257.8408
You will go to London	23.4885
Arrived in London you will	1343.6128

Like the ancient paladins he	670.3824
If he becomes certain that	715.3023
That is not probable It	43.2859
If he persists His Eminence	2049.1497
Well did there not happen	67.4212
Why should not the king	929.5309
Does not your Eminence fear	3744.2329

I think nothing I quote	43.6717
Only I say that if	1726.4797
What do you require then	1125.1482
Then the miserable fanatic must	1795.3088
Then if he persists notwithstanding	1203.9272
That is it is it	397.3049
And now said Milady without	1205.7249

A CONJUGAL SCENE As Athos	440.7915
He opened the door of	920.7962

What has become of Monseigneur	28.4491
Monseigneur replied Porthos he has	866.4532
At a short distance a	223.9341
These were the two men	921.9499
The attendant confirmed to the	302.6308
The cardinal made an approving	1099.3206
Let us leave him to	848.9797
For a hundred paces he	771.7846
Having recognized the laced hats	1731.3949
The host recognized him <PAD>	10.1488
My officer said Athos has	765.3583
He entered the chamber and	35.9017
At the noise he made	110.2412
Athos was standing before the	483.4451
On seeing this figure mute	230.6515
Who are you and what	28.4322
Humph murmured Athos it is	1418.6779
Do you know me madame	13.7523
Milady made one step forward	251.3211
So far well said Athos	2453.7090
Yes Milady replied Athos the	1169.4447
Sit down madame and let	1526.5044
You certainly are a demon	63.5628
Your power is great I	604.9032
You have once before thrown	40.7640
I thought I had crushed	1528.8995
Yes hell has resuscitated you	29.4028
Hell has made you rich	1217.3959
Athos remained sitting <PAD> <PAD>	8.0764
You believed me to be	93.7611
And the name of Athos	1773.4073
Was it not so you	115.8660
Our position is truly a	60.7724
We have only lived up	1087.0753
Listen <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8460
It was you who cut	689.0065
In short it was you	666.6845
You must be Satan cried	18.8246
Perhaps said Athos But at	55.7835
Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham	299.1124
I dont know him <PAD>	8.6813
Besides he is an Englishman	10.3058
But do not touch with	843.5333
Is it possible to insult	910.7236
The sight of this creature	314.1075
He thought how one day	551.3474
His desire for blood returned	2346.2786
Milady pale as a corpse	1918.6090
Motionless against the dark tapestry	920.7518
Athos slowly raised his pistol	1434.3785
Nevertheless she remained motionless <PAD>	10.5386
You have one second to	21.8998
Milady saw by the contraction	952.9849
Take it said she and	648.3663
It is by my order	301.4736
RICHELIEU And now said Athos	1474.2949
At the door he found	108.5595
Gentlemen said he Monseigneurs order	1491.0342
With regard to Athos he	1234.4026
In one of those halts	158.1919
He had no doubt it	38.1781
He immediately made a new	1903.9288
Who goes there cried he	72.5296
That is our brave Musketeer	48.1246
Yes monseigneur said Porthos it	812.6754
Gentlemen we are arrived take	33.9241
The watchword is King and	1890.9148
Well said Porthos and Aramis	566.4354
Only they sent Mousqueton to	709.0593
Milady as Athos had foreseen	606.6898
She had had for an	589.4438
She might say that Athos	329.4559
She thought it was best	2296.0815
In consequence after having traveled	1681.8385
Chapter XLVI <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6611
THE BASTION SAINTGERVAIS On arriving	1609.4602

I hope what you have	585.9144
Ah why were you not	17.6867
It was warm work We	1002.8757
Hush said Athos <PAD> <PAD>	6.0310
Oh oh said DArtagnan comprehending	108.0462
It appears there is something	1087.1915
The day before yesterday was	932.0719
I want to know if	1140.3676
Yes Athos I know what	942.9797
Porthos followed chatting with Aramis	14.4784
On their way they met	17.8991
Athos made him a sign	24.6761
Grimaud according to custom obeyed	1122.5277
They arrived at the drinking	36.9587
It was seven oclock in	72.3458
The three friends ordered breakfast	534.7296
Unfortunately the hour was badly	59.8959
The morning drum had just	2641.4458
Dragoons Swiss Guardsmen Musketeers lighthorsemen	2695.9324
Thus they applied very curtly	357.0526
I see how it will	787.5987
DArtagnan tell us what sort	814.5341
I hear you gentlemen of	566.1182
Well said Athos dont you	441.1115
Relate what has passed during	882.8543
Yes monsieur said DArtagnan bowing	40.3844
We even have as you	1089.1591
Without reckoning that as the	1225.7838
The bastion St Gervais replied	6359.1040
We lost five men and	2650.0283
But it is probable said	2464.7671
Gentlemen said Athos a wager	137.2258
What is it said the	13.6065
Stop a bit said the	1876.4358
You cursed host <PAD> <PAD>	9.3215
a dripping pan immediately that	1887.9192
Now for the wager <PAD>	8.6327
We listen Monsieur Athos Yes	61.9347
Well Monsieur de Busigny I	1210.2910
But said DArtagnan in the	702.5152
Will that do Capitally replied	43.2082
Perfectly said the dragoon <PAD>	9.2582
That shoots me said the	17.6615
The fourth auditor who during	1511.7114
The breakfast for these gentlemen	42.8160
Well bring it said Athos	10.7043
The host obeyed <PAD> <PAD>	8.5537
Athos called Grimaud pointed to	1004.7176
Grimaud understood that it was	936.1260
But where are you going	69.8913
What matter if you are	453.6629
Shall I give you the	39.5489
No only add two bottles	1321.9565
Monsieur de Busigny said Athos	837.0455
As long as they were	892.5629
But when once they passed	1161.9442
And now my dear Athos	476.5584
Here at least said Athos	716.5507
Better then pursue our enterprise	263.0093
We have made a wagera	1072.4645
We are going in order	166.1080
Either we shall be attacked	19.3011
If we are not we	956.8763
Moreover in defending ourselves we	98.6442
You see that everything is	1217.5798
Why should we load ourselves	3306.5940
DArtagnan said that in the	1085.9651
It appears the conquerors had	2295.8967
DArtagnan alone did not seem	18.8943
Grimaud no doubt shared the	868.4453
Where are we going asked	28.9716
Athos pointed to the bastion	12.4917
But said Grimaud in the	1279.7096
Grimaud put his basket on	193.9277
Athos took a pistol from	1528.6838
Grimaud was on his legs	49.5598
Athos then made him a	179.3259
Grimaud obeyed <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.8094
All that Grimaud gained by	667.8488
Arrived at the bastion the	36.7529
More than three hundred soldiers	1042.3560
Athos took off his hat	334.3975
All the spectators returned him	1686.1747
Chapter XLVII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6086
THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS	7148.2671
Gentlemen said Athos who had	1396.4329
We can talk while performing	50.1476
These gentlemen added he pointing	1127.1302
You are mad dear friend	365.4356
How many guns gentlemen Twelve	39.8585
How many shots A hundred	202.2940
Let us load the guns	2027.8363
Athos replied always by gestures	1034.1422
Only to alleviate the tediousness	1196.4263
And now to table said	12.9113
The four friends seated themselves	816.4683
And now said DArtagnan as	657.0246
I have induced you to	1520.2146
The secret is said Athos	792.8646
You forget my dear you	582.9095
I have seen Milady Where	31.8649
Within two leagues of this	1039.7567
Not so bad yet replied	1129.7260
But after all asked Porthos	1109.4625
Villainous host cried he he	1049.6034
Yes continued he a charming	1436.6511
by demanding my head of	79.3253
Yes that is true as	500.7280
Then said DArtagnan letting his	291.7610
I may as well blow	939.2510
First my stranger of Meung	2445.2283
Pardieu if we may believe	563.0325
What is it Grimaud <PAD>	7.7408
Considering the gravity of the	342.5773
What do you see A	5691.6431
We have just time to	956.5201
Well then to my health	10.3933
although I am very much	693.8345
Porthos Aramis and DArtagnan followed	19.0222
As to Grimaud he received	657.2941
Pardieu said Athos it was	2771.5796
Grimaud had only to make	454.8046
Besides in addition to the	1880.3580
My faith said Aramis I	1943.1337
I will warn them What	961.0599
Mounting on the breach with	617.7430
Now you know nothing is	203.6711
We request you then if	1029.1678
Four shots replied to them	2224.4583
Grimaud said Athos still on	126.7096
On their part the three	318.9496
The brigadier and two pioneers	243.4900
Now gentlemen a sortie cried	18.9755
And the four friends rushed	1068.9224
Reload the muskets Grimaud said	570.2596
Where were we I recollect	720.9190
Whither goes she added he	161.1012
She goes into England said	18.2558
With what view With the	2648.6526
But this is infamous cried	14.1987
As to that said Athos	149.8740
Now you have done Grimaud	1822.0449
An instant afterward the white	272.6654
A thunder of applause saluted	241.0098
How replied DArtagnan you care	372.4114
But the duke is our	212.7021
Let her do what she	989.4702
A moment said DArtagnan <PAD>	7.8705
I will not abandon Buckingham	21.9351
He gave us some very	1413.0068
Besides said Aramis God desires	955.8097
And this carte blanche said	2576.2219
Exactly And you have that	31.8652
Here it is said Athos	186.8468
DArtagnan unfolded it with one	682.7077
It is by my order	301.4736
RICHELIEU In fact said Aramis	1764.4756
On the contrary said Athos	44.4690
I would not give up	1019.5070
Why replied Athos carelessly she	1522.8998
The cardinal will remember that	930.2462
It appears to me you	88.4691
I do not jest said	15.3365
Do you know said Porthos	2502.7830
I say I am entirely	54.4779
And I too said DArtagnan	9.3532
Fortunately she is far off	1326.6560
She worries me everywhere said	20.0582
But when you held her	863.4177
It is only the dead	737.8483
I have an idea said	13.0836
What is it said the	12.4245
To arms cried Grimaud <PAD>	9.9140
The young men sprang up	48.1191
This time a small troop	1651.9620
Shall we return to the	21.2292
I dont think the sides	178.4014
The first that we have	618.6188
As soon as the enemy	204.8727
If they continue to advance	45.1880
We must fire as long	60.7313
If those who remain of	1055.8042
Decidedly Athos you were born	776.2819
And I mine said Porthos	10.5641
And I idem said Aramis	12.8213
Fire then said Athos <PAD>	7.6637
The four muskets made but	88.3824
The drum immediately beat and	191.6860
Then the shots were repeated	263.7680
Nevertheless as if they had	958.9747
With every three shots at	772.3070
Arrived at the foot of	218.9573
A last discharge welcomed them	2170.6753
Now my friends said Athos	42.8270
To the wall to the	969.6295
Then a fearful crash was	512.3915
Can we have destroyed them	73.3079
My faith it appears so	21.3645
No cried Porthos there go	1921.8073
These were all who were	34.4421
Athos looked at his watch	11.2451
Gentlemen said he we have	807.7965
Besides DArtagnan has not told	1494.3411
My idea said DArtagnan <PAD>	8.4385
Yes you said you had	21.5675
Oh I remember said DArtagnan	10.0052
Well I will go to	584.4863
And why not <PAD> <PAD>	6.5378
Have I not been there	165.2090
At that period Buckingham was	88.4066
What you would now do	451.1054
But said Porthos I think	509.0843

They are beating the general	808.4007
You see they are going	129.2488
You dont think of holding	138.9943
Why not said the Musketeer	11.1300
I feel myself quite in	850.7701
Let it come said Athos	9.7633
It is a quarter of	868.5426
That is more than time	81.9137
If we go from this	125.9020
Ah stop <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.8771
I have it gentlemen the	1393.9674
Grimaud said Athos pointing to	1071.9573
I comprehend now You comprehend	26.9123
And do you comprehend Grimaud	19.6482
Grimaud made a sign in	17.6895
Thats all that is necessary	369.2772
That is useless Yes yes	13.1040
Athoss idea cried Aramis and	33.5611
This Milady this woman this	1047.2523
If he detested her it	64.0648
In that case we are	551.3151
What is her brotherinlaws name	1055.5444
It is he whom we	18.7183
We will have him informed	700.1992
There is in London I	615.7048
He must place his sister	691.0557
I have given you all	285.8315
And I for Planchet said	12.0005
Ay said Porthos if we	913.8654
Give the lackeys money and	217.2045
Have you any money The	1063.2837
Look out cried DArtagnan I	217.3135
Why did you talk of	23.6093
It is a veritable army	138.8277
See the sneaks come without	52.6818
Ah ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.2075
have you finished Grimaud Grimaud	884.4875
Some carried arms others seemed	774.1232
Bravo said Athos that does	823.4022
I am of DArtagnans opinion	1225.1135
We bet upon one hour	151.3977
Nothing can be said let	1016.0912
The four friends followed ten	37.0721
What the devil shall we	41.3211
Have you forgotten anything said	14.9920
The white flag morbleu We	1692.5789
But Athos might be said	47.7269
The balls passed and whistled	93.6879
Athos waved his flag turning	606.8550
On both sides loud cries	1046.6238
A second discharge followed the	976.8566
Cries were heard from the	29.7299
come down Athos came down	302.1274
Come along Athos come along	1389.9120
Grimaud and his basket were	175.9076
At the end of an	70.4282
Whats that asked Porthos what	41.6552
I hear no balls whistle	685.1484
But the dead can not	45.2488
They will then fancy it	965.5495
That renders it useless to	1176.0355
Thats lucky said Athos shrugging	29.4590
On their part the French	676.0441
At length a fresh discharge	1443.8601
The Rochellais had at last	62.4442
These Rochellais are bungling fellows	4910.1821
Ah but what is the	29.3172
It bleeds seemingly Oh its	46.9315
A spent ball Not even	945.0806
Only grazed a little replied	1375.1786
Ah to be sure cried	36.3358
Why the devil then do	1052.1731
Well thought of Porthos this	1287.4865
The queen saving Monsieur de	119.7737
The queen saving us her	57.1275
Let us sell the diamond	12.8186
What says Monsieur the Abb	12.7793
I dont ask Porthos his	1145.2819
Your advice then is To	57.4876
Well then said DArtagnan gaily	1060.2823
My faith it was time	77.5240
Here we are at the	133.1915
We are observed they are	34.4847
We shall be carried in	475.3138
More than two thousand persons	1850.0171
Nothing was heard but cries	46.0591
Live the Guards M de	638.2072
The dragoon and the Swiss	401.3347
There was nothing but felicitations	1105.2241
The tumult at length became	1814.2605
The affair was described to	119.8141
Well asked the cardinal on	48.5250
Well monseigneur replied the latter	2165.7273
And the Guardsman DArtagnan Still	47.3273
Positively these four men must	745.9061
M de Trville who had	759.8775
Thats well Monsieur de Trville	268.2261
I will have three fleurdelis	1225.7388
Monsieur dArtagnan is not with	1052.5470
DArtagnan was beside himself with	16.5916
We know that the dream	99.9623
The three friends were likewise	35.7501
My faith said DArtagnan to	53.7609
As you said we have	1297.5089
M Dessessart who esteemed DArtagnan	1540.9908
DArtagnan refused but thinking the	632.6071

This was the price of	22.5821
Chapter XLVIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.4594
A FAMILY AFFAIR Athos had	134.1212
A family affair was not	409.2211
People might employ themselves in	96.7787
Therefore Athos had invented the	39.0349
Aramis had discovered the idea	19.7382
Porthos had discovered the means	17.6157
DArtagnan alone had discovered nothinghe	998.8259
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
no we were mistaken he	92.6315
The breakfast at M de	176.1101
DArtagnan already wore his uniformfor	1548.1046
DArtagnan would have been at	897.8500
After breakfast it was agreed	1478.3308
DArtagnan passed the day in	248.3511
In the evening at the	51.2939
There only remained three things	1932.2384
Everyone offered his own <PAD>	9.3681
Athos talked of the discretion	748.7591
Porthos boasted of the strength	818.8938
Aramis confiding in the address	274.2339
Finally DArtagnan had entire faith	729.2716
These four virtues disputed the	1611.0864
Unfortunately said Athos he whom	1095.6364
I know it well so	244.2116
Planchet is brave and shrewd	1036.2563
Monsieur Abb you are a	1028.1632
Thats wisenot for the lackeys	360.6913
Are our lackeys sufficiently devoted	162.7140
No My faith said DArtagnan	13.5248
I would almost answer for	1309.4712
you will be deceived just	1100.4451
They will promise everything for	590.2969
Once taken they will be	102.7065
What the devil <PAD> <PAD>	6.1871
we are not children <PAD>	8.7986
To reach EnglandAthos lowered his	1300.2501
A passport for embarkation must	1139.2018
Really I think the thing	809.2430
It would be no doubt	1918.9650
of intrigues and secrets of	128.3377
There can be no doubt	1026.7821
I will write to him	1585.5879
Monsieur and dear friend Ah	15.6243
Dear friend to an Englishman	49.8825

Well then we will put	1910.9296
Where your life was spared	33.2608
thats unworthy <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3776
A man of spirit is	71.5763

Draw up this note for	1804.1859
I have heard here and	81.7346
I have obtained proof of	209.8821
sacr bleu said Athos <PAD>	10.1741
But continued Aramis the details	78.3152
DArtagnan and Athos looked at	63.2722
At length Athos after serious	1384.4701
Well this is what you	774.6904
Repudiated by her husband said	13.9286
Because she had been branded	24.4259
Bah cried Porthos <PAD> <PAD>	6.6873
Impossible <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8443
What do you saythat she	541.6531
Yes And her husband found	258.5834

DArtagnan and I <PAD> <PAD>	5.1448
Or rather to observe the	76.5865
And does the husband of	91.1096
He still lives Are you	824.2349
This time said Athos first	1199.0490
You are right Athos said	81.7764
The chancellor himself would be	2620.4875
Never mind <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4496
Be silent I will write	2413.2869
As you have several times	884.7870
Twice you have nearly been	743.6212
But the third time which	55.7780
Your relative left La Rochelle	81.8861
Watch her arrival for she	55.8315
If you require to know	1402.5603
My dear Aramis you have	59.2892
Lord de Winter will now	755.6590
But as the lackey who	1302.3220
Have you the diamond continued	12.9344
I have what is still	13.6567
I have the price and	64.5742
At the sound of the	77.6836
As to Athos he remained	15.6774
How much in that little	1982.1758
That poor little diamond was	772.8817
I dont suppose that our	707.3683
Let us take some heed	105.3951
That is the least we	1220.5206
Write a second letter for	1927.7152
My dear cousin Ah ah	29.8051
This clever person is your	7692.8433
It is probable that the	571.9112
I will even venture to	1183.8506
His Eminence is the most	790.2067
He would extinguish the sun	69.9484
Give these happy tidings to	69.7967
I have dreamed that the	42.0987
I can not recollect whether	896.7179
Be assured then of seeing	768.0385
You speak like the Apocalypse	94.6729
There is nothing now to	430.1568
He folded the letter fancifully	260.1100
Michon seamstress Tours The three	356.4932
Now said Aramis you will	461.8440
My cousin knows nobody but	1158.6450
Besides Bazin is ambitious and	3518.3040
Well as he means to	920.5889
You can understand that a	790.7152
Milady had him one day	1265.4967
Now Planchet has an excellent	1650.8864
If your arrangements at Tours	247.7791
I request then that Planchet	972.0339
With that you may be	874.3764
We will each take a	831.4417
Will that do My dear	1094.9413
Planchet and Bazin shall go	11.6301
Everything considered I am not	548.1848
Yesterdays affair must have shaken	1377.1597
The matter had been named	466.8293
I will carry the letter	710.7586
You will give me a	663.7856
If on the sixteenth day	965.5481
Remember if you talk if	1629.8038
But remember also that if	1024.9380
And I said Porthos rolling	1028.7762
We will not venture to	1280.4701
DArtagnan took his hand <PAD>	8.2572
See Planchet said he these	633.0223
He gained just twelve hours	1096.0017
In the morning as he	595.8613
Listen said he to him	7.5266
When you have given the	449.7027
But this Planchet is so	857.1509
Bazin set out the next	507.1353
The four friends during the	1053.3181
Their days were passed in	539.4565
More than once an involuntary	379.3757
They had besides to look	1557.4851
On the morning of the	1047.4381
It is true however that	75.9209
Aramis blushing in spite of	755.0157
Good God cried he laughing	1677.7743
Oh pardieu less than nothing	2060.5039
See what she writes to	27.4604
Athos cast a glance over	1967.5009
Adieu <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8384
Take care of yourself and	263.4305
MARIE MICHON And what dream	639.6037
Yez whats the dream said	21.6621
Well pardieu said Aramis it	874.3376
Neffer neffer DArtagnan seeing Athos	261.8817
Porthos and Aramis remained behind	194.3660
As to Bazin he went	627.5701
But as we have said	671.2470
The days of expectation are	808.1329
He forgot the necessary slowness	347.0245
He credited this woman who	1064.6666
Still further his confidence in	475.9643
This anxiety became so great	100.7960
Athos alone remained unmoved as	1189.5187
On the sixteenth day in	798.4760
Really said Athos to them	256.3057
And what does it amount	25.4235
To be imprisoned <PAD> <PAD>	7.7593
Well but we should be	145.4252
To be decapitated <PAD> <PAD>	8.3354
Why every day in the	2708.9463
Wait quietly then in two	417.1693
He promised to be here	475.5482
Well if he does not	209.3885
He may have fallen from	1100.6523
Eh gentlemen let us reckon	38.0950
Life is a chaplet of	175.9263
Be philosophers as I am	206.5206
Nothing makes the future look	2083.2493
Athos started passed his hand	1020.4680
The day however passed away	209.7376
The bars were filled with	25.5442
Athos who had pocketed his	179.2745
He had found in M	985.0013
They were playing together as	1143.5983
At half past seven the	38.0409
We are lost said DArtagnan	30.5589
You mean to say we	1076.6733
Come gentlemen said he they	39.1249
Let us to bed And	130.6686
Aramis came behind giving his	28.7066
Aramis mumbled verses to himself	1269.7327
But all at once a	628.7761
Planchet repeated Aramis and Porthos	11.2867
Well yes Planchet to be	140.6970
He promised to be back	88.1383
Bravo Planchet you are a	499.4032
DArtagnan felt a strong inclination	1308.4076
I have the note said	34.5791
Thats well said Athos let	396.0898
He wished to hasten their	634.0277
At length they reached the	1158.6129
It contained half a line	2287.3799
DArtagnan translated this for the	15.7637
Athos took the letter from	493.6765
Then calling Planchet he said	1761.2251
Well cried DArtagnan tell us	1797.0311
Go to bed Planchet and	81.8354
that will be the first	273.6181
And me too said Porthos	10.1149
And me too said Aramis	10.1941
Well if you will have	42.2552
Chapter XLIX <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6487
FATALITY Meantime Milady drunk with	3844.3552
This idea soon became so	1654.8508
But the wind was contrary	180.8089
Nine days after leaving the	3128.6833
She calculated that to cross	632.1349
Add another day for landing	45.6165
Add these four to the	2315.2788
She reflected likewise that the	1125.4906
She allowed the vessel to	1505.3125
Milady therefore continued her voyage	1070.4836
All the city was agitated	43.0098
Four large vessels recently built	85.2576
At the end of the	1532.4556
It was one of those	722.2999
The star of day pale	1475.6854
Breathing that sea breeze so	1887.1182
They entered the roadstead but	2074.0986
This boat contained an officer	95.5569
The officer alone went on	517.9788
The officer conversed a few	1143.4097
When this species of summons	2623.3406
Then the officer began to	575.8262
He then returned to the	302.6176
Then the vessel resumed its	2037.2404
The boat followed in the	249.0622
During the examination of Milady	1349.0723
But however great was the	922.3267
The officer who had stopped	925.1917
He was of pale complexion	2040.1674
When they entered the port	31.6723
The fog increased the darkness	1979.0686
The air they breathed was	55.2146
Milady that woman so courageous	116.8416
The officer desired to have	805.9221
When this operation was complete	229.0664
Milady looked at this man	17.6147
Who are you sir asked	1038.7642
But is it the custom	739.1460
Nevertheless they had not the	38.4623
But I am not a	965.6356
The officer followed her <PAD>	9.7428
A large cloak was spread	1436.0669
Row said he to the	10.1796
The eight oars fell at	1417.5742
In five minutes they gained	25.2530
The officer leaped to the	93.9050
A carriage was in waiting	10.6953
Is this carriage for us	22.8118
Yes madame replied the officer	10.9515
The htel then is far	1719.6528
The officer saw that the	1520.8831
Immediately without any order being	1634.3900
So strange a reception naturally	2323.4397
At the end of a	778.9839
Houses were no longer to	990.5115
Milady shuddered <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9105
But we are no longer	43.4191
The young officer preserved silence	16.3047
I beg you to understand	1021.0103
Oh this is too much	22.7330
Help <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8461
help No voice replied to	671.5351
Milady looked at the officer	972.4048
The young man remained immovable	14.7216
Milady tried to open the	74.5671
Take care madame said the	1206.6797
The officer leaned forward looked	1065.0393
The artful creature at once	2964.9080
At length after a journey	1839.6746
Then as the wheels rolled	2475.3958
The carriage passed under two	886.7545
Almost immediately the door of	668.5768
Still then I am a	1091.2572
My own conscience and your	1758.4844
Immediately several men appeared who	516.6462
Then the officer with the	159.0313
She with a stillsmiling countenance	1241.7004
They then came to a	579.6754
With a single glance the	183.8668
It was a chamber whose	1174.6562
In an instant all the	1556.5548
But no one entered except	2017.3114
The officer superintended all these	2272.3342
It might have been said	1262.1388
At length Milady could hold	137.3566
In the name of heaven	107.0298
Put an end to my	1040.5721
Where am I and why	18.8549
If I am free why	61.6956
If I am a prisoner	539.6281
I received orders to go	378.8706
This order I believe I	608.3428
There terminates at least to	1084.8730
Can you not tell me	591.9611
Some voices passed and faded	280.8204
That person is here madame	971.4890
At the same time the	64.5342
He was without a hat	164.4318
Milady thought she recognized this	908.8227
The stranger advanced slowly and	2161.8013
Then when she had no	771.2482
Let us sit down and	1531.7695
All is well I thank	9909.7354
She knew her brotherinlaw to	3125.7993
How had he discovered her	69.8799
Why did he detain her	12.2322
Athos had dropped some words	1072.5494
She rather feared that her	196.5680
Buckingham might have guessed that	821.4742
This supposition appeared to her	29.2225
It seemed to her that	215.2490
At all events she congratulated	2003.6532
Yes let us chat brother	1104.8058
You have then decided to	834.9216
To begin with tell me	786.4706
But tell me my dear	726.8931
Ah to see me said	27.5855
To be sure to see	11.7455
What is there astonishing in	597.8122
What tenderness my sister But	2282.6816
And my only heir are	943.5384
Whatever command she had over	1807.6648
In fact the blow was	30.1977
The first idea that occurred	1172.5851
She also recollected the furious	1276.6348
I do not understand my	472.7003
What do you mean to	12.2474
Is there any secret meaning	2376.0977
You wish to see me	28.7441
I learn this desire or	846.4916
What is there more astonishing	336.3436
Have you not observed that	937.3526
I am commandant of the	17.4710
They brought me that book	12.9988
I recognized your name in	13.4276
My heart told me what	1066.4364
You know the rest Milady	380.9612
My brother continued she was	906.4700
Ah I can understand how	143.4610
You came from a country	843.6516
Is he not your friend	33.6879
Ah pardon <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.6830
I thought so but we	93.8402
Let us not depart from	111.6549
You came you say to	438.7392
Do you find yourself badly	34.7836
Demand anything you want and	675.0149
Tell me on what footing	1252.8035
Yes your French husband <PAD>	10.2834
I dont speak of my	15.6005
If you have forgotten as	516.0883
You jest said she in	30.4765
Do I look so asked	118.0155
Or rather you insult me	1380.4200
I insult you said Lord	47.0642
In truth madame do you	1512.2631
Leave the room and send	175.0057
Can not I serve you	31.4610
By that means all our	1350.7014
Come said he <PAD> <PAD>	5.3823
I know you are accustomed	944.9738
You have all the appearance	876.9731
Milady uttered a deep inward	1569.2351
Oh growl as much as	1264.6184
There are here no procurators	98.5487
There is no knighterrant to	931.8577
And these judges I warn	1405.1362
However he continued all the	940.6817
Not a penny of what	83.5503
Were you not already rich	98.9316
And could you not stop	1140.6976
Oh be assured if the	981.0535
I will be silent but	83.9939
In fifteen or twenty days	1031.8395
And be assured that you	724.8883
Yes at present continued Lord	119.5193
The walls are thick the	1350.7085
The men of my crew	1053.5095
Even if you gained the	315.9917
The order is positive <PAD>	10.6612
A step a gesture a	995.9837
If they kill you English	593.4183
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
I see your features regain	239.7797
You are saying to yourself	58.5655
Bah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8473
I have an inventive mind	268.7960
I have an infernal spirit	15.9867
I shall meet with a	16.3613
Before fifteen days are gone	2520.9084
Lord de Winter continued The	723.3387
He knows how as you	1242.2944
What do you say of	10.5452
Could a statue of marble	112.8627
You have already tried the	1170.6198
Pardieu if you succeed with	780.8267
Call Mr Felton said he	14.6986
Wait a minute longer and	1285.4719
Shortly a human form appeared	799.4932
Come in my dear John	554.9117
Now said the baron look	22.3491
She is young she is	112.0449
Well she is a monster	1004.1251
Her voice prejudices her hearers	4306.0195
She will try to seduce	112.8436
I have extricated you from	1427.0189
I am for you not	224.5405
This woman has come back	340.2026
I hold this serpent in	23.2585
Well I call you and	1668.1823
Swear by your hopes of	393.7449
John Felton I trust your	20.8127
John Felton I put faith	1784.9410
Lord de Winter himself could	771.3022
She is not to leave	81.9050
She is to correspond with	670.5007
I have sworn And now	1688.8333
Lord de Winter went out	509.7635
One instant after the heavy	1400.6349
Milady remained for some minutes	1023.7901
Chapter LI <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.7050
OFFICER Meanwhile the cardinal looked	1182.5033
Although La Rochelle was invested	2602.1785
This was a great affront	579.6231
with Anne of Austriafor that	2274.5305
As to Monsieur who had	277.0853
The city notwithstanding the incredible	2761.3416
This execution quieted the illdisposed	3241.9771
On their side from time	1377.0736
In one case or the	50.6087
The cardinal pronounced the single	453.8821
He came languidly placing himself	184.2353
This amused him sometimes a	1324.8152
Nevertheless time passed on and	49.3315
The last spy that was	63.3021
This letter told Buckingham that	2077.3689
Buckingham was their Messiah <PAD>	10.7831
It was evident that if	1351.9198
The cardinal looked then with	951.1604
The question of carrying the	1983.7445
In the first place La	47.9768
Then the cardinal whatever he	923.3318
In fact the sack of	1452.9872
The cardinal could not drive	1613.6921
Had she betrayed him <PAD>	9.3700
Was she dead <PAD> <PAD>	6.9330
He knew her well enough	852.5281
That was what he could	14.0713
And yet he reckoned and	43.2769
He had divined in the	1234.1401
He resolved then to carry	757.4678
He continued to press the	407.0934
Meanwhile he cast his eyes	2117.7866
The cardinal had little notes	1857.4376
These leaders had corn in	1888.4648
Up to that time whether	1424.4912
The notes reminded the men	1331.8333
These notes had all the	855.8264
But at the moment when	929.6311
Still further Buckingham announced to	1525.6290
This letter was read publicly	69.5136
Copies were put up at	1020.4344
This unexpected circumstance brought back	1860.2013
During this time exempt from	1653.8971
All the corps rivaled one	104.0118
To take spies and hang	3004.8997
Sometimes when the cardinal always	1649.5165
One day when oppressed with	1494.3446
Mingling the immensity of his	1223.8477
Four of these men were	497.2856
This letter was so important	624.0239
The other three were occupied	1619.5522
The cardinal was as we	496.5540
Besides he had another strange	1026.0122
Making a sign to La	1916.2291
At ten paces from the	999.4838
It may be supposed that	268.8161
His eyes took a strange	701.6705
Officer cried Grimaud <PAD> <PAD>	7.0694
You are speaking you scoundrel	757.5776
Grimaud therefore added nothing to	1472.7042
With a single bound the	190.8522
The cardinal seemed furious <PAD>	11.5584
It appears that Messieurs the	68.8200
Are the English expected by	2783.6123
Lackeys who have the order	2111.4001
DArtagnan continued Athos you who	1551.7919
DArtagnan came forward and stammered	1302.6487
It does not signify gentlemen	1133.5031
I do not like to	1128.2520
Then he resumed in his	541.8050
We are not on duty	728.0975
If we are so fortunate	1227.0078
Your Eminence may perceive continued	2039.6665
Your Eminence may believe added	781.7715
Do you know what you	662.1357
You look like four conspirators	1672.4952
Only we conspire against the	1546.7057
One might think you really	380.1945
If it be so we	1195.6028
Others besides you have undergone	1215.7280
He turned round as if	141.9901
Athos saw the movement he	798.1186
The cardinalists were three the	116.1765
He judged that the match	1258.2683
Well well said he you	213.4091
We can find no fault	659.2552
Gentlemen I have not forgotten	452.9997
If there were any danger	706.7207
Adieu gentlemen And remounting his	1084.4888
The four young men standing	1238.4790
Then they looked at one	14.0324
The countenances of all gave	1680.8619
Athos alone smiled with a	47.2814
When the cardinal was out	1159.1561
Grimaud was about to reply	22.2667
Athos lifted his finger and	31.6949
Would you have given up	31.5989
I said Aramis in his	122.5376
If he had insisted upon	439.6473
Indeed this man is very	644.9117
Whose then is the air	18.6107
Whose is the ocean upon	23.8418
Whose is the sand upon	36.9041
Whose is that letter of	16.6016
Do these belong to the	13.6631
Upon my honor this man	56.6288
There you stood stammering stupefied	33.4231
One might have supposed the	917.2540
Is being in love conspiring	15.7317
You are in love with	536.1361
Thats a match you are	160.0694
Why should you expose your	43.5119
That is never done <PAD>	8.7304
Let him find it out	20.2257
We can find out his	133.0374
In that case let there	1263.8973
You had only read a	694.1218
MY DEAR COUSIN I think	1949.3794
Nevertheless if the affairs of	630.0534
Meanwhile she is not very	249.9711
I know that such viands	1624.1041
My sister thanks you for	63.0603
She has experienced much anxiety	1615.7247
Adieu my dear cousin <PAD>	10.2302
Tell us news of yourself	532.6362
I embrace you <PAD> <PAD>	7.2657
MARIE MICHON Oh what do	83.4997
Dear Constance <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6817
I have at length then	21.9487
She lives she is in	119.6293
Where is Bthune Athos Why	179.3910
The siege once over we	961.5536
Supposing that after having eaten	1186.6199
As if the Catholic religion	413.0086
All the same resumed he	710.1772
But what the devil are	36.1956
Why you are squeezing that	559.7687
And yet if we burn	1769.2948
What will you do with	28.4938
Come here Grimaud said Athos	11.2125
Grimaud rose and obeyed <PAD>	9.4698
As a punishment for having	980.2020
First here is the letter	9.2891
Eat heartily Grimaud smiled and	759.7761
Bravo Monsieur Grimaud said Athos	28.2298
Thats well <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.1634
We dispense with your saying	3376.9370
And now said Athos unless	1689.2118
CAPTIVITY THE FIRST DAY Let	3367.6201
We shall find her still	1963.3247
On two occasions her fortune	1555.6541
DArtagnan has conquered herher that	78.8675
He has deceived her in	1662.4299
Still more he has lifted	1226.3591
DArtagnan has turned aside from	2744.6228
DArtagnan had passed himself upon	1986.4071
DArtagnan knows that terrible secret	268.6840
In short at the moment	1036.2445
All this she owes to	29.3765
From whom can come so	273.9872
He alone could have transmitted	1585.6990
He knows her brotherinlaw <PAD>	11.8604
He must have written to	13.0127
What hatred she distills <PAD>	14.2805
Motionless with her burning and	1818.0918
How many magnificent projects of	3132.6272
Bonacieux against Buckingham but above	266.8289
Yes but in order to	65.7139
And to be free a	2614.9817
Besides to do all this	1079.0977
And yet if she were	1069.1180
The first moments of her	2341.2964
But by degrees she overcame	3124.8069
Go to go to <PAD>	6.6660
I must have been mad	1367.9113
No violence violence is the	37.7681
In the first place I	47.1022
Perhaps if I employed my	2630.6284
Let me fight like a	819.2614
Then her hair assumed successively	2609.8059
At length she murmured satisfied	1829.9762
Milady perceived a bed she	897.9926
A better idea however came	104.2591
She had heard something said	21.0163
She had already been an	495.2874
The prisoner did not wish	828.9885
A light appeared under the	181.5909
Milady who had arisen threw	3456.8672
The bolts were drawn the	94.9500
Steps sounded in the chamber	26.6157
Place that table there said	132.1878
The order was executed <PAD>	10.0191
You will bring lights and	89.1351
And this double order which	974.5043
Feltons orders were for the	670.7600
At length Felton who had	164.2444
Ah ah said he she	42.2499
When she wakes she can	195.9322
But my lieutenant said a	1426.4773
Her face is very pale	761.5577
Go and tell Lord de	1372.4023
Felton sat down upon an	1137.7317
Milady possessed that great art	1949.1090
She perceived Felton who sat	63.5665
She continued to look at	1220.5637
She then thought that Lord	588.4511
Her first trial was lost	347.4024
As a result she raised	141.0665
At this sigh Felton turned	25.3674
Ah you are awake madame	103.9438
If you want anything you	85.7318
how I have suffered said	1374.0525
And she assumed upon sitting	1500.5081
Felton arose <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.7422
You will be served thus	73.3206
In the morning at nine	210.1530
If that does not suit	855.5836
A woman of the neighbourhood	715.4838
Felton made a slight bow	87.2450
At the moment he was	564.0383
He held a vial of	43.6435
Well what is itwhat is	761.4106
Is this corpse come to	21.5816
Felton my lad did you	639.0565
These words of Feltons passed	94.7007
So replied de Winter laughing	2678.1750
She has a fruitful imagination	1058.4921
Oh I will be a	1265.5166
Taste that fowl and those	18.5979
On my honor they are	20.0307
I have a very good	567.5117
Do as I do <PAD>	6.9517
Adieu dear sister till your	329.0629
Her hands clutched her armchair	1845.4382
She cast her eyes upon	963.2240
The blade was round and	37.1724
A burst of laughter resounded	376.6547
Ha ha cried Lord de	58.1248
Dont you see my brave	96.3344
That knife was for you	65.1737
Observe this is one of	882.1070
If I had listened to	117.8799
Then no more of Felton	392.7985
See John see how well	3235.2500
The knife fell to the	15.0538
You were right my Lord	935.0464
But this time Milady lent	1251.7323
I am lost murmured she	27.6003
I am in the power	990.7680
It is however impossible that	2384.1147
Milady sat down to table	1880.1115
Before she went to bed	1608.1047
One expression above all recurred	766.6916
Felton then had spoken in	539.6806
Weak or strong repeated Milady	1121.9595
As to the other he	430.3402
It is useless then to	32.6343
But Feltonthats another thing <PAD>	13.6051
He is a young ingenuous	1995.5059
Anyone who had seen her	765.3806
Chapter LIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6108
CAPTIVITY THE SECOND DAY Milady	2027.6652
She slept as a prisoner	99.5956
In the morning when they	84.9391
Felton remained in the corridor	10.8390
He brought with him the	498.6084
Milady was habitually pale her	610.5807
I am in a fever	462.3727
I suffer horribly <PAD> <PAD>	10.2124
Are you likely to be	110.8784
All I ask is permission	570.6364
Felton listened to this dialogue	44.9477
Milady reflected that the more	521.4261
Besides the physician might declare	2299.3445
Go and fetch a physician	19.0072
What could be the good	12.6570
These gentlemen declared yesterday that	1972.7880
My God <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4212
I know that I suffer	20.8689
Give me anything you like	1307.4758
Oh no no cried Milady	145.2504
I am well I want	2276.2034
He has come thought Milady	15.0172
Meanwhile madame if you really	1444.5894
But at least we shall	1395.7499
Felton surveyed her for an	1521.1732
The woman followed him and	68.2539
I fancy I begin to	2116.9336
Two hours passed away <PAD>	10.4568
Now it is time that	848.4095
I have but ten days	817.5977
Now she thought they could	726.6907
Milady was not deceived <PAD>	8.3369
Felton reappeared and without observing	1327.3888
Felton remained behind he held	46.1815
Milady reclining in an armchair	2411.4050
Felton approached her and said	865.7850
By that plain arrangement of	1422.6001
She then had one of	2080.4727
Those two words your Mass	1394.0824
My Mass Lord de Winter	1318.9589
I will tell it cried	1104.4344
The young officer however remained	162.5957
I am in the hands	613.8161
Well let my God save	118.6944
That is the reply I	70.2935
And as to this book	1044.2006
Lord de Winter came toward	48.0633
Milady had had time during	134.8347
She received him like a	122.9167
It appears said the baron	2050.4556
You have not by chance	1259.6917
Certainly that is most in	190.1127
Oh I confess it is	879.2623
Either I misunderstand you or	2113.8127
Heyday madame <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.3315
you are taking a poetical	497.5855
As to the rest in	563.6318
impious task cried Milady with	299.7231
My word said de Winter	138.9796
Come come calm yourself Madame	182.0358
Its my Spanish wine that	91.6131
But never mind that sort	1673.3887
Felton was indeed behind the	112.9973
Milady had guessed aright <PAD>	12.2224
Yes go go said she	994.4641
Two hours passed away <PAD>	10.4568
Miladys supper was brought in	1269.3604
She appeared to be in	485.0231
Felton made a sign that	559.6276
Milady knew she might be	491.0257
For the moment she wished	19.7001
She arose came to the	134.1400
An hour after her table	991.0081
He feared then to see	28.3762
She turned toward the wall	1028.9691
She allowed therefore half an	721.4025
While singing Milady listened <PAD>	15.9660
The soldier on guard at	257.1284
Milady was then able to	67.1787
Then she continued her singing	85.4722
It appeared to her that	1236.9622
It however likewise appeared that	3057.6650
Your song is as dismal	1487.7581
What are you meddling with	19.2448
Did anybody order you to	64.3621
No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8453
You were told to guard	219.0324
Guard her <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.8423
If she flies kill her	4325.3638
Without appearing to have heard	712.0293
Felton believed he heard the	431.9796
Milady continued One day our	4042.9019
He opened the door quickly	1533.6830
Why do you sing thus	55.0232
Your pardon sir said Milady	30.7194
I forgot that my songs	86.1435
I have perhaps offended you	392.4257
Pardon me then a fault	959.5131
Yes yes said he you	990.2485
I will be silent then	1106.4011
No no madame said Felton	2197.0923
You have done right Lieutenant	30.2831
Such songs disturb the mind	911.0338
CAPTIVITY THE THIRD DAY Felton	717.8339
He must be retained or	1489.7784
Still more must be done	11.4340
He must be made to	1267.5306
Yet in spite of all	1345.6151
From that moment she watched	995.1093
In short she studied everything	2310.0352
Face to face with Lord	147.8426
She had laid that down	27.7708
To remain silent and dignified	1606.2034
Felton would see all perhaps	75.8986
In the morning Felton came	2007.9563
At the moment when he	596.0648
Toward midday Lord de Winter	24.9019
It was a tolerably fine	1855.4786
Milady was looking out at	168.8818
Ah ah said Lord de	4870.9072
Yes yes continued Lord de	31.8688
You would like very well	73.9984
You would like very well	995.3560
Patience patience <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.2403
In four days time the	1170.2670
At the moment he went	837.1988
Then she threw herself upon	75.0944
My God my God said	1758.6068
God of goodness <PAD> <PAD>	6.9984
wilt thou allow the frightful	1009.0228
I do not like to	1319.1658
You were deceived sir I	1108.9067
God forbid <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.4260
Besides repentance becomes the guilty	1530.0337
I said Milady with a	260.5991
Guilty <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8472
Oh my God thou knowest	57.4707
Say I am condemned sir	1464.4752
I can hold out no	681.3184
Listen then to the supplication	35.6231
You are abused sir but	37.6711
I only ask you one	471.5886
It is upon one higher	1186.1713

Oh you do not understand	11.4683
When I speak of ignominy	287.5115

Of what consequence to me	780.6766
Or rather who pretend not	259.1250
No madame on the honor	617.1525
Are there then in England	3305.6670
Whom Pagans and unbelieving Gentiles	253.9363

One minute that knife one	723.5936
Only one minute Mr Felton	2584.2795
He knows all <PAD> <PAD>	7.1217
My God I am lost	123.7160
He still doubts thought Milady	2205.6672
Felton recognized it also and	50.7217
Milady sprang toward him <PAD>	10.0981
Oh not a word said	263.8167
Felton gently repulsed Milady and	91.9769
Lord de Winter passed before	736.7588
Felton as pale as death	1633.4449
Ah said Milady listening in	1220.1511
If he tells the baron	885.7719
Oh yes said she smiling	739.9179
Sir said Milady is your	148.8554

Did not you sentimentally inform	920.6482
Well here I am be	14.6263
Besides this time my visit	433.7707
Perhaps never in her life	1539.5513

Lord de Winter took a	338.5292

I will begin again then	3579.6238
She is to dwell in	250.4341
In case of any attempt	173.8502
She will receive five shillings	147.9583
That order does not concern	1241.5839
Have you a name then	189.6181
My brother is only your	105.4344

Everything in her mind was	814.1221

Yes yes said Lord de	839.0607

The day after tomorrow it	1384.8273
Adieu madame <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.3240
That is all I had	334.4072
You know that the English	129.1476
Speak freely <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0655
Although my name or rather	799.4200
Oh I see you prefer	20.2260
Thats well madame and there	755.6291
you are not wrong after	43.2020
Thats the reason why I	166.5415
There only remains then the	109.0126
You think me rather parsimonious	25.6809
Thats because I dont care	162.1186
Besides you will always have	86.4385
Employ them if your check	1656.6659
Nothing is lost then And	70.2347
Tomorrow I will come and	1002.0168
Milady breathed again <PAD> <PAD>	8.2743
She had still four days	20.7400
Four days would quite suffice	118.9168
A terrible idea however rushed	40.1887
She thought that Lord de	1546.7499
In that case Felton would	2611.2822
Nevertheless as we have said	35.9272
Felton had not spoken <PAD>	8.4135
As she would not appear	901.9880
Then as she had done	479.1745
As on the evening before	106.8496
Soon after she heard lighter	798.7022
It is he said she	8.2825
And she began the same	544.6229
But although her voicesweet full	1044.3704
It appeared however to Milady	982.1109
But whether this was reality	332.8051

CAPTIVITY THE FOURTH DAY The	6584.7329
At the noise Felton made	1946.0360
The young man was more	961.5627
Nevertheless his brow was armed	132.5069
He advanced slowly toward Milady	2371.3621
That <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8481
Nothing said Milady smiling with	582.3025
Ennui is the mortal enemy	1758.4458
He started and the prisoner	423.2896
What were you doing on	29.1687
Of what consequence replied Milady	16.8836
But replied Felton I wish	591.2076
Remember madame if our God	6196.8140
In the name of heaven	1303.1289
No sir <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.0826
Besides of what importance to	127.1934
You are only responsible for	48.4746
And provided you produce a	1443.6708
You suppose that I would	76.0354
Oh you can not believe	1008.4778
Every soldier must be ambitious	28.2623
You are a lieutenant <PAD>	8.3890
Well you will follow me	359.4535
In a few days you	685.2971
Cruel enough if I am	663.4751
You are not willing that	646.7711
who dares to answer for	1863.4542
A prisoner you will not	948.3358
To see this woman so	1797.8617
Milady saw the trouble <PAD>	8.7950
She felt by intuition the	1001.1285
As a skillful general seeing	2301.3518
Thy God shall teach thee	33.5247
From th abyss hell give	2689.7139
Who art thou <PAD> <PAD>	9.0523
Who art thou cried he	37.2365
Art thou a messenger from	4641.4824
I am neither an angel	1277.0409
You believe and yet you	471.8832
You believe and yet you	1349.9744

what mean you by that	803.2867
Yes I recognize the voice	683.0828
However fugitive this homicide flash	3029.3252
He recalled all at once	2061.3813
He drew back a step	1283.0273
Milady was not a woman	68.7029
Under her apparent emotions her	117.1429
Before Felton replied and before	1169.9796
The sword of the eternal	58.4597
Allow me then to avoid	229.0791
I do not ask you	548.6315
Let me die that is	12.0138
I supplicate you I implore	1165.7845
By degrees the enchantress had	1960.4696
Alas said Felton I can	461.9434
But Lord de Winter makes	73.3849
You are a Christian you	46.7018
I feel myself drawn toward	2600.8376
But you madame so beautiful	1693.5791
Oh continued she placing her	141.9878
neverI could not To me	44.6000
Milady looked at him for	499.9438
Felton in his turn a	41.7714
Well then said Milady I	837.3768
He paused exchanged two words	169.4004
During the exchange of these	1631.1349
The baron entered slowly sending	266.3716
You have been here a	51.9678
Has this woman been relating	37.9478
In that case I can	1116.5205
Ah you fear your prisoner	33.4330
Well ask your worthy jailer	1764.5782
Yes my Lord replied the	26.8102
And what favor pray asked	39.7320
A knife which she would	593.9536
There is someone then concealed	2455.2175
There is myself replied Milady	13.7484
I have given you the	245.7059
Choose Tyburn madame <PAD> <PAD>	9.4181
Believe me the cord is	1484.0701
You are right said she	537.2381
Mistrust yourself John said he	12.5637
I have placed reliance upon	28.8595
Beware <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8425
I have warned you <PAD>	8.7361
But be of good courage	924.6835
Felton lowered his head and	17.5007
The baron took the young	608.9188
Well said the prisoner when	255.1349
De Winter has changed his	116.1730
It is the desire of	79.0943
As to Felton he hesitates	16.4712
Ah he is not a	31.4135
A Puritan only adores virgins	304.5278
A Musketeer loves women and	2767.8948
At last in an hour	1050.1271
Presently the door opened and	28.4135
The young man advanced rapidly	916.9295
What do you want with	18.1505
Listen replied Felton in a	23.7103
I have just sent away	945.6481
The baron has just related	1949.3451
Either you are a demon	467.8336
I have known you four	78.8444
I therefore may hesitate between	19.2212
Be not alarmed at what	59.5731
Tonight after twelve I will	768.0803
No I am lost do	32.1938
My death will be much	858.2515
If when you have seen	586.4791
Are you satisfied Well said	1068.7766
The soldier returned and Felton	70.1605
Then through the grating to	1382.4211

CAPTIVITY THE FIFTH DAY Milady	1338.9094
It was not difficult to	1212.1381
Milady was handsome enough not	865.3050
But this time she had	998.9735
Religion and its observances had	274.2430
There fermented in that sublimated	3786.1187
Milady had then made a	1203.5479
In short she had taken	2418.4834
Many a time nevertheless during	154.4606
She did not invoke God	2117.0972
Milady being well prepared for	903.6833
She knew she had only	1403.9996
To be a woman condemned	1475.5011
Like all persons of real	400.4010
Poverty was repugnant to her	157.5997
Milady was only a queen	29.2361
The pleasure of satisfied pride	69.7752
To command inferior beings was	185.9266
She should certainly return from	1744.2432
For an active ambitious nature	979.7016
What word then can be	196.3933
To lose a year two	1176.6941
For the rest the storm	1129.9327
Then that which spurred her	320.6973
What must the mistrustful restless	3445.0752
She knew him she knew	719.2685
The cardinal would reply with	1515.1011
Time however passed away the	945.6887
At nine oclock Lord de	1353.2330
Doubtless both of them understood	1565.9648
Well said the baron on	1192.7039
Milady recognized his step <PAD>	9.7793
She was as well acquainted	367.0155
That was not the appointed	12.9086
Felton did not enter <PAD>	9.0092
Two hours after as midnight	73.6879
This time it was the	122.1682
The new sentinel commenced his	53.0184
At the expiration of ten	37.2798
Milady was all attention <PAD>	8.3460
Listen said the young man	16.1565
On no pretense leave the	1037.9774
I recommend you therefore to	48.9186
For my part I am	1442.4838
Zounds Lieutenant said he you	1822.8879
Under any other circumstances he	2325.5457
If I call come said	12.2660
If anyone comes call me	72.7993
Felton entered Miladys apartment <PAD>	13.3107
Milady arose <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.7478
You are here said she	9.7738
I promised to come said	844.9761
You promised to bring a	782.5413
There is no situation however	1511.3806
I have reflected and I	551.8566
You may retire said Milady	15.7180
I will not talk Here	1225.2789
Let me see it said	14.7296
For what purpose Upon my	106.2876
You shall place it on	922.6716
Well said she returning the	197.9364
You are a faithful friend	1270.2565
Milady followed him with her	68.8812
Now said she listen to	47.9775
The young officer stood upright	324.1314
Felton said Milady with a	982.7007
While yet young unfortunately handsome	96.7985
I resisted <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6397
Ambushes and violences multiplied around	58.6918
The religion I serve the	1521.7565
Then outrages were heaped upon	1643.6772
Finally Milady stopped and a	89.1516
Finally said Felton finally what	2080.6770
One evening he mixed a	70.3297
Scarcely had I finished my	586.0469
Although I was without mistrust	534.3508
I arose <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.7579
I wished to run to	377.7677
It appeared as if the	314.7980
I stretched out my arms	13.1620
I tried to speak <PAD>	8.9524
I could only utter inarticulate	220.8269
I supported myself by a	1145.2758
I fell upon one knee	35.8397
I tried to pray but	46.9584
God doubtless neither heard nor	1543.8673
Of all that passed in	634.5785
The only thing I recollect	849.8805
No door gave entrance to	18.0379
It might be called a	23.8039
It was a long time	433.4591
My mind appeared to strive	871.8821
I had vague perceptions of	1107.5819
At times the state into	392.6960
I arose trembling <PAD> <PAD>	8.6648
My clothes were near me	729.2974
Then by degrees the reality	170.4202
I was no longer in	45.2816
As well as I could	339.9029
It was the evening before	544.6205
What had taken place during	31.4955
I dressed myself as quickly	2271.5715
The chamber was evidently furnished	992.5209
Certainly I was not the	875.6381
Yes it was a prison	104.9355
I sounded all the walls	1069.2129
I made the tour of	932.7264
I sank exhausted with fatigue	82.8937
Meantime night came on rapidly	86.9375
I did not know but	77.1998
It appeared that I was	498.3051
Although I had eaten nothing	296.5198
No noise from without by	884.2210
All at once the noise	177.6965
A globe of fire appeared	1736.6760
A table with two covers	1412.4423
That man was he who	691.5070
Oh yes scoundrel cried Milady	1965.6929
Oh yes scoundrel <PAD> <PAD>	8.9325
He believed having triumphed over	138.4055
He came hoping that I	1260.7217
All that the heart of	1254.6573
Doubtless he was accustomed to	762.3199
Then when he thought I	595.2195
Take one step more said	629.4177
Your death said he oh	790.4637
Adieu my charmer I will	1110.1373
I found myself again in	26.3643
The same noise of a	1733.0337
This moment was frightful if	1615.1309
I was in the power	664.7706
I passed the night on	796.2457
But the night passed away	222.7544
Day came the table had	117.4099
This knife was my only	15.6297
I was worn out with	18.0613
Sleeplessness inflamed my eyes I	121.7138
The light of day reassured	1239.8859
When I awoke a fresh	35.9649
This time in spite of	717.0977
It was fortyeight hours since	71.1142
I ate some bread and	1731.5081
And yet notwithstanding these precautions	299.1833
But my fears were this	761.7811
I took the precaution to	483.4221
The evening came on and	982.0051
I saw amid the shadows	1698.2355
In an instant thanks to	117.5989
I was determined to eat	789.9969
Two eggs and some fruit	3051.7046
At the first swallow it	189.6918
Suspicion instantly seized me <PAD>	10.4396
I paused but I had	57.9935
I threw the rest away	365.1757
No doubt some invisible witness	1481.7183
Half an hour had not	734.3345
I dragged myself toward the	1862.6653
I sank on my knees	1394.7593
And what was most frightful	1363.9181
It is true that all	138.2708
I saw the lamp ascend	838.8815
I felt instinctively that someone	1812.3669
I wished to make an	64.5583
By an incredible effort of	1149.2979
Milady saw at a single	1981.6797
The more profoundly she wounded	177.9588
She continued then as if	477.9265
Only this time it was	575.1476
I have told you that	1137.5261
I struggled then with all	1023.1810
I knew very well that	1520.4161
this desperate resistance could not	29.4775
I felt my strength fail	903.6743
The sweat streamed down his	585.1089
My first impulse on coming	866.2607
But on taking this knife	115.6887
I have sworn to tell	58.6171
I have promised you the	634.6686
Yes said Milady <PAD> <PAD>	7.6479
The idea was not that	1165.0521
In short what shall I	924.8701
This idea occurred to me	558.8550
I had no doubt he	39.6318
During the day I had	17.5205
When the hour of breakfast	176.4105
I had determined to make	72.7777
I was forced then to	206.7763
Only I concealed a glass	1267.7471
The day passed away without	1026.9335
Several times even I felt	44.1578
Felton I dare not tell	490.1833
go on said Felton you	819.9605
During the darkness as before	31.6228
Then the lamp was lighted	50.4631
I only ate some fruit	17.3202
I pretended to pour out	1002.0435
The substitution was made so	555.3157
After supper I exhibited the	1195.9540
I found my knife where	1184.6005
Two hours passed away without	50.8375
Oh my God <PAD> <PAD>	6.6029
who could have said so	19.2964
I began to fear that	25.3795
At length I saw the	1167.2319
Nearly ten minutes passed I	233.3354
I implored heaven that he	25.2605
At length I heard the	678.9525
haste said Felton do you	1855.5636
I looked upon myself as	1032.3577

He had foreseen all <PAD>	9.6852
His breast was covered with	130.5286
Ah ah cried he seizing	1306.0066

Come come calm yourself my	27.8673

The second night the door	437.6521
At the noise I raised	38.7579
Well said a voice which	446.4871

Will we not pay for	105.6339
Come I am a good	610.8242

In the midst of one	80.6986
Terror recalled me to myself	11.6650
He entered the apartment followed	47.1118
He was masked likewise but	1131.0012

But cried Felton that is	892.6680
The brand of Englandit would	1351.9869
Pale motionless overwhelmed by this	2755.9182
The brand disappeared the beauty	32.3172
Pardon <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8507
Pardon cried Felton oh pardon	127.7146

Pardon me for having joined	245.3305
So beautiful <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5959

Milady let one of those	208.8476
Felton was a Puritan he	162.3186
He no longer loved her	31.4843
When this crisis was past	1783.5636
I have only one thing	145.3987
For to me there is	573.5129
Have you not yet divined	288.8836
Whatthe truly guilty The truly	4714.1973
It is then Buckingham cried	122.4637
Milady concealed her face in	880.0933
Buckingham the executioner of this	54.7215
And thou hast not hurled	129.3756
And thou hast left him	2454.1816
But he will draw upon	869.1135
He wills that human vengeance	3133.0754
But how can Lord de	2958.4329
I had an affianced husband	1781.9247
I went to him and	336.6636
He was a nobleman a	89.3190
He said nothing he only	1168.9357
Yes yes said Felton I	54.9440
But with such men it	719.3686
My affianced husband returned <PAD>	13.1963
Hear me said he this	624.3400
Yes said Milady Lord de	182.3858
Buckingham remained nearly a year	21.9273
A week before his return	307.2763
Whence came the blow <PAD>	8.4876
God who knows all knows	1794.5128
Lord de Winter died without	69.4301
The terrible secret was to	1019.9543
Your protector had seen with	401.6705
I was sensible that I	753.4764
I went to France with	159.1445
But all my fortune is	17.6512
Communication being closed by the	58.6501
I was then obliged to	23.9351
Six days ago I landed	94.5136
Well Buckingham heard by some	72.8472
He spoke of me to	1156.2524
The noble and pure voice	175.5568
Lord de Winter believed all	502.1265
He caused me to be	283.6502
You know the rest <PAD>	7.8666
The day after tomorrow he	1299.8552
Oh the train is well	57.8717
My honor will not survive	16.5186
You see then Felton I	50.3377
Felton give me that knife	2033.4824
No no said he <PAD>	6.9220
No you shall live honored	1912.1418
Oh death death said she	535.4409
Felton my brother my friend	1494.7330
Felton abandon me <PAD> <PAD>	7.5521
Felton let me die Well	722.0368
Several strokes resounded on the	292.8012
Hark said she we have	18.9475
Someone is coming <PAD> <PAD>	6.7086
All is over <PAD> <PAD>	6.2421
We are lost No said	846.3217
He found himself face to	115.7819
Well what is the matter	26.3487
You told me to open	591.5526
I heard you cry out	43.7159
I tried to open the	686.0383
Felton quite bewildered almost mad	44.7523
Milady plainly perceived that it	148.5696
She ran to the table	938.2282
At that moment a burst	123.8288
The baron attracted by the	776.3571
Ah said he here we	67.3139
You see Felton the drama	2731.3035
You are mistaken my Lord	1487.8658
He was too late Milady	44.9179
But the knife had fortunately	1738.0637
It had glided down it	877.3738
Miladys robe was not the	83.6012
Milady fell down and seemed	39.3611
Felton snatched away the knife	14.8381
See my Lord said he	590.9681
She is not dead demons	54.4874
Be tranquil and go wait	1424.5836
As to Lord de Winter	977.6245
Meanwhile all things considered and	1438.2400

ESCAPE As Lord de Winter	147.4911
So soon as she was	695.2493
It was however necessary to	2453.8694
Thus the poor woman was	1593.3026
But the presence of this	94.5695
There was no longer a	171.6339
If an angel appeared to	1143.7930
Milady smiled at this thought	386.8503
But Lord de Winter might	215.3546
Toward four oclock in the	1236.7811
The doctor could therefore measure	2014.5045
In the morning Milady under	966.6021
She had one hope which	608.8442
Were her fears realized <PAD>	12.7899
Was Felton suspected by the	199.0337
She had only one day	13.8394
Lord de Winter had announced	491.1650
Nevertheless she still waited patiently	64.2563
Although she had eaten nothing	241.3690
Milady then perceived with terror	209.4658
Then she ventured to ask	54.5009
She was told that he	111.3899
She inquired if the baron	38.8001
The soldier replied that he	462.3786
Milady replied that she was	346.5170
The soldier went out leaving	36.5663
Felton was sent away <PAD>	8.8930
The marines were removed <PAD>	14.0677
Felton was then mistrusted <PAD>	10.2532
This was the last blow	17.6710
Left alone she arose <PAD>	10.1585
The bed which she had	1409.6581
She cast a glance at	330.0997
He no doubt feared that	957.7601
Milady smiled with joy <PAD>	9.8819
She was free now to	128.8510
She traversed her chamber with	2428.1414
Certes if the knife had	646.7433
At six oclock Lord de	33.6016
He was armed at all	17.8396
This man in whom Milady	1103.4521
He appeared to foresee all	72.6820
A single look at Milady	203.0772
Ay said he I see	49.4694
You have no longer a	88.7426
You had begun to pervert	43.9625
He was yielding to your	92.4481

Get your clothes together <PAD>	10.5780
Tomorrow you will go <PAD>	7.4753
I had fixed the embarkation	865.1993
Tomorrow by twelve oclock I	183.8434

If when on the ship	683.7225
That is agreed upon <PAD>	9.4790
Au revoir then that is	46.4030
Tomorrow I will see you	253.5425
Milady had listened to all	1298.6874
Supper was served <PAD> <PAD>	6.8057
Milady felt that she stood	54.3121
She did not know what	2302.3406
The storm broke about ten	24.4552
Milady felt a consolation in	196.3697
The thunder growled in the	181.7996
It appeared to her that	1075.7275
She howled as the hurricane	1098.5901
All at once she heard	828.3456
She ran to the window	18.9049
Felton cried she <PAD> <PAD>	6.5006
I am saved Yes said	52.8156
I must have time to	47.1440
Only take care that I	550.8486
They have closed up the	853.6907

Nothing nothing only shut the	16.1652
Go to bed or at	66.6343
As soon as I have	172.7617
But will you be able	1807.6493
Amid the moaning of the	662.9479
She passed an hour without	2901.2310
There are hours which last	19.6847
At the expiration of an	56.9178
Milady sprang out of bed	30.3391
Two bars removed formed an	113.2458
Are you ready asked Felton	14.5236
Yes <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8439
Must I take anything with	802.8608
Felton took the bag and	61.0913
Now said he will you	733.9257
She saw the young officer	194.3611
For the first time an	144.9210
The dark space frightened her	17.9568
I expected this said Felton	14.4078
Its nothing its nothing said	19.2097
I will descend with my	179.9901
You ask that Put your	39.1424
Cross them thats right Felton	1934.1115
What are you doing asked	31.9767
Pass your arms around my	1164.0149
I am a sailor Not	50.8194
Milady passed her two arms	441.7443
Felton began to descend the	67.1481
Despite the weight of two	239.9793
All at once Felton stopped	15.7983
What is the matter asked	15.7670
Silence said Felton I hear	463.1008
No said Felton it is	1137.4062
My God Silence Both remained	3824.4368
This was a terrible moment	21.9906
The patrol passed <PAD> <PAD>	8.7130
The noise of their retreating	328.1823
Now said Felton we are	239.3664
Felton continued to descend <PAD>	9.2618
Near the bottom of the	692.7661
He stooped down picked up	276.6779
Then he took Milady in	844.0624
He soon left the pathway	999.2112
A similar signal replied to	470.8980
The boat approached as near	713.2924
Felton walked into the sea	784.7912
Fortunately the storm began to	94.2214
The little boat bounded over	77.5374
To the sloop said Felton	1947.2445
However they left the castle	55.9714
The night was extremely dark	15.4110
It was almost impossible to	698.7157
A black point floated on	27.1608
That was the sloop <PAD>	8.5190
While the boat was advancing	1782.8672
When her hands were loosed	416.6182
Milady breathed a sigh and	28.7138
Where am I said she	8.8797
Saved replied the young officer	10.3486
Oh saved saved cried she	14.8464
Yes there is the sky	27.1420
The air I breathe is	33.3894
Ah thanks Felton thanks The	119.3062
But what is the matter	786.8618
Alas said Felton looking at	178.9605
Oh its nothing nothing cried	21.0732
I remember now Milady looked	131.9428
It is there said Felton	118.6728
They drew near to the	16.4924
A sailor on watch hailed	59.2661
What vessel is that asked	17.5526
The one I have hired	629.7852

She could read to the	508.8338
Felton cried she you are	60.6582

Felton mounted the ladder first	883.6078
An instant after they were	25.4592
Captain said Felton this is	617.2696
I have paid you five	118.5172
And here are the other	420.2800
No said the captain I	446.6804
During this passage Felton related	2159.8252
Milady knew the rest <PAD>	8.5266
On her side Milady tried	1894.5231

When he compared the public	3144.0933
This was because his love	1775.5709
The rapidity of his walk	1154.8793
He entered Portsmouth about eight	46.1531
The whole population was on	1585.7837
Felton arrived at the palace	289.0969
His countenance usually so pale	111.4598
The sentinel wanted to repulse	1019.1949
Felton darted into the palace	13.6333
At the moment he entered	1116.3645
Felton and he addressed Patrick	157.7497
Felton named Lord de Winter	807.9918
Each was anxious to gain	40.9133
Patrick who knew Lord de	686.8333
The other was forced to	316.6348
The valet led Felton through	3045.0850
Lieutenant Felton from Lord de	50.4278

At that moment Buckingham was	2039.8921

Well then speak That which	704.9053
I shall call you presently	46.1868
We are alone sir said	1311.7260

My Lord continued Felton becoming	284.6225
All England is tired of	1684.1329
God will punish you hereafter	1518.3114
Felton barred his passage <PAD>	11.5845

At that moment Patrick entered	3415.3132
Felton took advantage of this	274.6255
Ah traitor cried Buckingham you	197.0738
Felton cast his eyes round	835.5441
I guessed it <PAD> <PAD>	7.1858
But too late by a	335.5102
Lord de Winter placed him	799.5104
At the cry uttered by	857.6709
He found the duke reclining	226.6619
Laporte said the duke in	1118.9563

Night overtook her she stopped	62.1090
At five oclock the next	370.3245
She inquired for the convent	92.7828
The superior met her Milady	81.1863
The abbess assigned her a	76.9340
All the past was effaced	826.7175
The evernew passions which consumed	2371.7034
After breakfast the abbess came	55.4344
There is very little amusement	915.1823
Milady wished to please the	18.3457
This was a very easy	154.8632
She tried to be agreeable	1360.2744
The abbess who was the	1219.3170
Milady on the contrary was	2148.8765
She made it her business	1558.5660
But the abbess contented herself	193.3487
Milady however saw that this	1064.5448
But she was greatly embarrassed	15.2469
She did not know whether	2039.1569
But the abbess on her	2701.1233
Milady began to think she	1511.5428
Desirous of seeing how far	1230.1608
dAiguillon Marion de Lorme and	92.3689
The abbess listened more attentively	180.4974
Good thought Milady she takes	63.2422
If she is a cardinalist	1891.3530
The abbess only crossed herself	112.1176
This confirmed Milady in her	364.4611
Milady therefore continued coloring her	60.6145
I am very ignorant of	1153.9650
And one of our boarders	1197.5822
Poor woman <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4546
I pity her then And	148.9049
Imprisonment menaces ill treatmentshe has	54.2476
But after all resumed the	2460.7520
I am about perhaps to	1239.5507
Alas said Milady I know	21.1800
It is said that we	436.1602
As for me I shall	686.9905
At what said Milady with	38.2629
At the language you use	398.9900
You are the friend of	536.8304
At least you dont speak	622.1070
Do you believe there is	612.9998
If I were a man	170.2606
This young boarder of yours	1539.4044
The abbess looked at her	1102.5948
You are not an enemy	114.3918
WhoI cried Milady I a	21.2516
Oh no <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.9359

Why this evening said the	31.8472
But you have been traveling	98.8573
This morning you rose at	156.5704
Go to bed and sleep	3257.8643
During the last fifteen days	1327.4850
She therefore took leave of	1133.2528
She remembered that almost unlimited	573.4902
She had succeeded DArtagnan was	29.7994
One thing alone frightened her	1337.7639
But alas if he was	547.7827
All these hopes were so	1142.7375
She was awakened by a	178.7497
She opened her eyes and	1530.6736
The face of the young	47.3136
Each examined the other with	2810.7749
Milady however smiled in observing	1355.6840
It is true that the	1014.3834
The abbess introduced them to	29.7625
When this formality was ended	820.4404
The novice seeing Milady in	888.2284
How madame said she I	558.9707
This awakening you have given	952.7905
The novice sat down <PAD>	14.4019
How unfortunate I am said	319.6759
You arrive and your presence	1440.1340

All my misfortunes arise from	785.6992
Are you also the victim	878.9110
But you madame you appear	998.8259

The queen herself does not	87.0681

That is to say replied	1078.3580

Well if you know them	92.9428
Why do you not apply	892.0565

Bonacieux my punishment is drawing	25.7954
Tomorrow this evening perhaps I	1205.5052
What do you mean <PAD>	8.1376
Do you expect news from	63.4394
DArtagnan here Himself But thats	27.3920
He is at the siege	53.8411
He will not return till	148.6053
But is there anything impossible	840.6286
The writing of Madame de	60.2214

I beseech you The superior	30.5699
Bonacieux retired <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.7453
Milady remained alone with her	43.1115
An instant later the jingling	1197.8717
Milady uttered a cry of	750.9892
Chapter LXII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6342

At a solitary and retired	755.7350
The messenger resisted my brother	102.9121
Bonacieux shuddering <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3521
Remember that was the only	11.0125

The young woman complied <PAD>	12.0116
Rochefort passed at a gallop	11.7446
Adieu brother cried Milady <PAD>	12.5190
The chevalier raised his head	1131.6798
The good George said she	549.4019
And she resumed her seat	159.9771
Dear lady said Mme <PAD>	12.7025

Now then all is agreed	1449.7103
Milady had told the truthher	1071.3221
She required to be alone	182.4988
She saw vaguely the future	1042.9993
What was most pressing was	35.0743
Bonacieux away and convey her	618.3316
Milady began to have doubts	1207.4412
Besides she felt as we	1342.9415
The principal thing for her	135.0431
Bonacieux in her power <PAD>	8.5100
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
Bonacieux was the very life	13.5901
This was more than his	462.9601
Now this point was settled	23.3302
Bonacieux without any suspicion accompanied	20.7213
Once concealed with her at	898.8048
In fifteen days at most	1285.6705
She would not be weary	25.2219
for she should enjoy the	1769.9269

You have restored my courage	1474.5573
He was to wait at	627.7365
In this case Milady would	195.9571

Bonacieux came in and to	895.1163
Milady asked some questions about	20.9130
It was a chaise drawn	2296.4080
Milady was wrong in fearing	28.3423
Bonacieux would have any suspicion	12.8521
The poor young woman was	1693.9514

Then it grew nearer and	624.9825
This noise acted upon her	1623.1813
Bonacieux rising all in a	244.7204
Nothing was yet to be	123.0986
Oh my God said Mme	14.3682
Bonacieux what is that noise	835.8661
Stay where you are I	31.4262
Bonacieux remained standing mute motionless	70.6983
The noise became louder the	463.8812

The noise became so distinct	495.4244
Milady gazed with all the	572.9094

At this moment they heard	509.9942
Then three or four shots	29.3070
For the last time will	31.7170

I have measures to take	669.9334
DArtagnan had so much confidence	497.7753
Porthos and Aramis regarded each	100.5624
Lord de Winter believed he	194.8803
Now gentlemen said Athos when	1507.1835
DArtagnan needs to be alone	43.5375
I take charge of everything	1668.6699
Porthos and Aramis looked at	45.6159

Then lackeys who ask questions	3554.5015
Besides Milady knew the masters	777.4017
All four were to meet	60.7883
If they had discovered Miladys	1324.9403

Athos walked in the direction	1039.7607
There he again appeared uneasy	101.6206
Fortunately a mendicant passed who	1196.1678
The mendicant hesitated at first	889.5835
Arrived at the angle of	402.7916
Athos went toward the house	1309.8971
Athos went round the house	950.1146
No light appeared through the	685.5161
It was dark and silent	24.5900
Three times Athos knocked without	44.1183
At the third knock however	56.8529
The door at length was	1043.5933

There was no family no	125.8705
Athos cast a cold and	807.9182
Then he explained to him	147.8056
But scarcely had he expressed	1356.9930

He had not chatted ten	733.3250
Planchet had no need to	19.6500
He hastened to the rendezvous	1024.5803
All their countenances were melancholy	159.3236
What is to be done	15.3411
To wait replied Athos <PAD>	9.4435
Each retired to his own	15.9209
At eight oclock in the	1050.4115
In an instant all five	22.3153
Each examined his arms and	33.1540
Athos came down last and	151.0857

At Herlier Planchet who led	79.8296
Several times Lord de Winter	852.2635
The travelers then comprehended that	1597.4235
The storm increased the flashes	2145.3677
The cavalcade trotted on more	32.2212
A little before they came	66.0628
They spread their cloaks <PAD>	12.9460
There remained three leagues to	264.7672
DArtagnan took off his hat	228.9248
He found pleasure in feeling	2213.3340
The moment the little troop	2671.7605
Athos recognized Grimaud <PAD> <PAD>	7.8417
Whats the manner cried Athos	10.4201
Has she left Armentires Grimaud	76.8344
DArtagnan ground his teeth <PAD>	10.3776
Silence DArtagnan said Athos <PAD>	7.7178
I have charged myself with	21.7869
It is for me then	97.6877
Grimaud extended his hands in	40.0998
Far from here asked Athos	11.1551
Grimaud showed his master his	31.1926

Grimaud shook his head negatively	16.7127
Silence then cried Athos <PAD>	8.4292
And the troop continued their	18.7672
Another flash illuminated all around	23.4358
Grimaud extended his arm and	1446.4670
One window was lighted <PAD>	9.6828
Here we are said Athos	9.5024
At this moment a man	420.2055
It was Mousqueton <PAD> <PAD>	6.4901
He pointed his finger to	28.8929
She is there said he	8.4266
And Bazin asked Athos <PAD>	9.9180
While I watched the window	67.6316
You are good and faithful	947.6230
The little house was surrounded	392.9391
Athos sprang over the hedge	1258.7292
He mounted the skirting stone	146.3913

Milady rushed to the door	17.9621
More pale and menacing than	70.7109
Milady recoiled uttering a cry	17.1278
DArtagnan believing she might have	1613.7583
Put back that weapon DArtagnan	147.7292
Wait an instant my friend	38.2264

All eyes were turned towards	167.7369
Even Athos looked at him	533.3328
After approaching Milady with a	1407.5892
Milady for some time examined	1724.2501
