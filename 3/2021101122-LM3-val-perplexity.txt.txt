Their spirits live in me	13.1206
I consult them when doubtful	982.4683
Listen to the voice of	844.4875
The soul forms its own	3916.2622
The journey was performed with	476.2628
Towns fled from them like	3231.9934
The following morning they arrived	253.4061
Without the loss of an	655.9690
The boat was built for	1892.5845
Morrel was not insensible to	859.7191
As the distance increased between	1636.3778
Ere long Marseilles presented herself	5954.6514
Powerful memories were stirred within	4213.5781
A vessel was setting sail	1142.0491
The passengers and their relations	2678.4714
Here said he leaning heavily	924.1744
I yet feel his warm	1150.5195
As he spoke and in	901.3547
Monte Cristo looked at her	670.3361
Oh heavens exclaimed Morrel I	1567.6085
Turning to his friend Dear	463.0054
Well then gowait for me	664.4588
Monte Cristo remained on the	1096.8899
It yet stood under the	1766.3503
Two stone steps worn away	1254.8590
The house with all its	1810.1378
The woman whom the count	954.9605
The worn out steps were	1845.9734
He entered without knocking or	906.3684
At the end of a	1545.4862
In this garden Mercds had	541.2051
The trees of the garden	123.2964
Monte Cristo on stepping into	865.0455
She had raised her veil	1220.5450
Monte Cristo advanced a few	83.6630
Mercds raised her head and	232.0025
Madame said the count it	553.3493
Alone in the world I	596.6907
He feels that every man	5208.7935
Had he remained with you	1346.7122
He will increase in strength	659.1396
Leave him to build up	656.6124
The bitter cup of adversity	1222.1857
You have acted kindly count	802.3285
I ought to meet death	1023.0600
I have been the cause	390.3015
You render me still more	155.5976
Hate reproach the man that	58.8842
For was it not your	970.9999
Oh look at me closely	795.8646
Oh look at me continued	1519.2949
Years of grief have created	133.6589
I neither reproach you nor	45.1844
Oh no Edmond it is	91.8395
Oh miserable creature that I	407.1028
I once possessed piety innocence	1505.7777
No said she withdrawing it	83.6670
You have spared me yet	524.2255
They were influenced by hatred	1792.6091
Nay do not press my	979.1183
See and she exposed her	2580.2568
You Edmond on the contraryyou	926.8196
But as for me I	829.4404
Monte Cristo took her hand	780.0764
It often happens continued she	376.9272
I believed you dead why	41.1704
What good has it done	979.2719
Why having recognized you and	474.2348
Ought I not also to	441.0718
Yet I let him die	10.5825
What do I say <PAD>	7.5210
Oh merciful heavens was I	2296.4834
In what am I benefited	1339.7518
Oh I have been base	1098.7074
You are a nobleminded woman	108.2052
Still I was but an	1827.6558
I take that God to	1045.9373
Butand I say it with	129.5771
Examine the past and the	954.8563
The most dreadful misfortunes the	1667.6406
From that time I looked	299.0741
Not a thought was given	738.9352
Like adventurous captains about to	2929.8767
Goodnatured confiding and forgiving as	1536.5018
Then I launched out into	58.3968
I overcame every obstacle and	3063.1287
Believe me that she who	434.9224
Like the gulf between me	731.5309
No there is nothing in	107.1174
But we must say farewell	1106.8660
I desire but one thing	1488.7012
I live as it were	33.1095
One is that of Edmond	59.7371
He had my love <PAD>	8.0027
That word ill becomes my	984.1816
The other grave is that	221.3370
I approve of the deed	1092.0579
Then I shall enjoy as	2696.0276
To say that I shall	1013.9036
I have no longer the	213.8022
However I shall have no	516.1712
Rumor will probably be busy	2358.0127
I will make myself acquainted	118.1318
But if he be willing	963.5796
I have been so overwhelmed	1027.8804
I live because it is	59.4043
If succor be sent to	665.7159
It is not so we	675.2019
Will you not even say	47.6565
On the contrary we shall	186.2560
I tell you so to	748.2001
Monte Cristo slowly left the	61.0750
But Mercds did not witness	671.6879
Her eyes were straining to	1111.8362
The Past The count departed	987.8889
Since the death of little	158.4837
Having reached the summit of	1673.4980
More than this the conversation	927.4492
A man of the counts	1493.9834
He thought he must have	611.3618
I can not have deceived	295.3071
What he continued can I	1071.7595
I can not reconcile myself	108.9358
The reason why I am	378.7633
The past like the country	263.8587
My position is like that	814.4948
Come then thou regenerate man	34769.2500
Too many diamonds too much	1998.3406
Hide thy diamonds bury thy	8275.7178
It was the same through	1182.0410
And yet they were the	732.5345
A pleasureboat with striped awning	52.7511
Monte Cristo called the owner	1155.6285
The weather was magnificent and	44.2395
The sun red and flaming	285.9129
The sea smooth as crystal	2073.6821
But notwithstanding the serene sky	1562.6604
The solitary light burning at	1648.2812
Like the streams which the	3203.4368
Clear sky swiftflitting boats and	3159.7632
As they reached the shore	778.0099
The journey had seemed very	218.1657
Each stroke of the oar	1924.8219
There had been no prisoners	1205.8824
A concierge waited at the	931.2936
The count inquired whether any	1251.0944
The concierge who attended him	54.0202
He visited his own dungeon	15.4265
He again beheld the dull	251.8458
His eyes rested upon the	1239.3610
Monte Cristo felt his limbs	233.4949
Are there any stories connected	1334.0076
He had almost forgotten his	479.7211
The count turned around and	1011.6927
Would you like to hear	586.4791
This dungeon said the concierge	1062.0356
Another person was confined in	481.2582
He thought that there had	755.2418
Could the prisoners see each	23.2758
Oh no sir it was	1022.8679
However be that as it	623.8297
Do you see it and	51.4502
Ah yes I see said	79.7822
The result was that the	521.2761
One day the old man	35.6097
Now guess what the young	986.7929
Did you ever hear of	967.1452
The jailer continued Now this	33.7785
He fancied that they buried	1268.2628
They never buried the dead	1241.8035
This is what was done	9.7106
The young man was thrown	526.7339
No he muttered the doubt	819.4305
And the prisoner he continued	241.9850
You can understand that one	812.6087
Ma foi yes though he	847.0335
Thus the poor sailor lives	1144.6501
Oh Villefort Villefort murmured the	1951.0505
Yes especially if you will	91.6978
No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8453
Yes No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.2633
repeated the count who seemed	507.3378
Come sir Wait said Monte	1081.2471
<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8457
They said he was so	707.8900
The guide carried away the	22.2355
The count had spoken correctly	15.2762
Scarcely had a few seconds	319.8780
Then he looked around him	45.8291
Yes he said there is	596.3229
Oh those figures how well	34.0108
I made them one day	614.6646
After finishing that calculation I	41.9107
I did not reckon upon	286.9284
He saw in fancy the	103.3443
On the other side of	777.9290
Oh God thou hast preserved	2055.7922
Follow me sir and without	826.0385
There again Monte Cristo was	74.8204
The first thing that met	833.6629
The sight of this instead	704.3936
This is where the mad	563.8175
From the appearance of the	881.4561
Poor things <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4853
Those must have been ten	833.3032
The guide took them thinking	1582.4662
Sir he said you have	502.5279
Sir he cried scarcely able	1253.2051
Shells <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8426
Strawwork <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8503
Thank you No sir neither	146.4958
What is it Listen said	857.4747
After some search I found	524.0675
I do not knowI only	1577.5945
A sort of book written	1489.0625
Then the count knelt down	416.0568
Oh second father he exclaimed	2749.3357
Remove from me the remains	867.3275
Here sir said a voice	16.9904
Monte Cristo shuddered and arose	13.2751
The concierge held out the	1011.7289
The manuscript was the great	233.1124
The count seized it hastily	2784.9678
Thanks father thanks And feeling	2206.2729
Here he said take this	482.8588
Woe he cried to those	699.6766
The victory was complete twice	78.7237
The name he pronounced in	303.0123
On landing the count turned	223.7406
He too ten years ago	426.7534
He who returned to France	719.5429
Morrel had indeed placed a	823.7540
The worthy merchant had been	29.8760
Dying in the arms of	368.4081
Two large slabs of marble	2929.3374
Morrel was leaning against one	175.7412
His grief was so profound	52.5086
Maximilian said the count you	223.6569
The dead are everywhere said	632.4147
Do you still wish to	561.9612
I am so unhappy I	1019.6052
I knew a man who	237.0793
He was young he had	374.1779
He was about to marry	858.1974
Maximilian shuddered <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9095
Fourteen years he muttered <PAD>	9.2527
Fourteen years repeated the count	11.0505
During that time he had	30.9191
He also Morrel like you	179.3183
Well at the height of	142.9486
At first perhaps he did	965.1127
One day he miraculously left	90.0151
His first cry was for	397.9120
Yes but your father died	1699.4619
He was then a more	784.3826
You see then Morrel that	773.0450
You have my promise he	202.5589
Only remember On the of	269.9340
On the a yacht will	455.9452
You will give your name	72.8535
It is understoodis it not	694.3343
I have told you twenty	309.1667
Morrel farewell Do you leave	89.3112
I leave you alone in	3416.2515
The story of Ganymede Maximilian	2955.8496
Will you accompany me to	614.1566
The white steam was ascending	358.5627
The steamer soon disappeared and	1368.8875
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
Peppino At the same time	2165.2791
He was travelling fast enough	435.2309
This man was dressed in	1121.3711
He might be recognized not	783.5681
Another proof that he was	731.5648
Allegro he called out to	52.4781
Moderato he cried as they	13.6431
And heaven knows there are	523.5797
These two words greatly amused	102.6741
On reaching La Storta the	3189.5178

Ten young descendants of Marius	2084.8391
Now as these street Arabs	1888.4305
The result was that when	763.9928
The Frenchman had been so	720.6028
He reached it before the	19.2351
The Frenchman entered leaving in	1437.0458
With the Frenchman the man	609.4810

Thomson French inquired the stranger	12.9017
An attendant arose at a	206.8682
Whom shall I announce said	20.4164
Baron Danglars Follow me said	18.2561
A door opened through which	61.0591
The man who had followed	65.1209
The clerk continued to write	896.1417
Then the pen of the	806.2964
You have found out that	1464.1401
Was it the Englishman who	858.3660
I mean the Russian prince	1710.8735
But you must let me	1601.9331
At the expiration of ten	131.9935
Well asked Peppino of his	14.3086
Joy joythe sum is large	1582.6956
Five millionsa pretty sum eh	4390.1987
Danglars looked radiant with joy	77.1315
Peppino followed Danglars <PAD> <PAD>	7.1043
According to the arrangements the	35.7242
The guide held the door	18.5431
Guides are useful people who	71.0263
Danglars leaped into the carriage	49.8348
The cicerone reclosed the door	133.4935
Peppino mounted the seat behind	13.4130
Will your excellency visit Saint	59.5978
I did not come to	1077.8701
Then your excellency is going	1306.2314
Ten minutes afterwards the baron	1153.4396
Danglars was tired and sleepy	430.2491
Peppino had a little spare	1056.6685
The next morning Danglars awoke	1317.5847
He breakfasted heartily and caring	2223.4414
But Danglars had not reckoned	321.9804
The horses only arrived at	372.9984
All these preparations had collected	1676.3812
The baron walked triumphantly through	2093.6887
The Ancona road replied the	21.9556
Signor Pastrini interpreted the question	102.9328
Danglars intended travelling to Venice	1483.4382
He had scarcely advanced three	232.2448
Danglars had not intended starting	831.8887
Non capisco do not understand	28.2730
Danglars bent his head which	389.4509
I will stop at the	56.8086
He still felt the same	817.2784
He was luxuriously stretched in	2167.5735
What subject of meditation could	292.0342
Danglars thought for ten minutes	1345.4829
Now and then a jolt	690.9384
But the night was cold	763.6738
The carriage stopped <PAD> <PAD>	7.4595
Danglars fancied that they had	914.4137
Danglars waited a moment expecting	574.2030
He intended taking advantage of	1410.6835
Danglars astonished opened the door	283.0755
The baron was completely roused	16.8256
Eh he said to the	2086.9377
But mio caro did not	31.1590
Danglars then opened the window	10.5557
Come my friend he said	1798.8496
Danglars thought dentro la testa	1622.3433
He obeyed not without some	1812.5813
His eyes acquired that quality	1299.3533
Before we are alarmed we	1142.4723
Danglars observed a man in	132.7307
Some gendarme he exclaimed <PAD>	9.7310
Can I have been intercepted	920.6078
Where are you taking me	15.1158
Dentro la testa replied the	124.2341
Danglars turned to the left	127.3525
Decidedly said Danglars with the	611.4846
Directly afterwards the moon rose	14.1578
He then saw the great	1114.7427
He understood that they had	190.9691
Oh unfortunate he cried they	879.8776
An hour of terror elapsed	476.2869
At length he saw a	668.5395
Mon dieu cried Danglars we	548.8772
Gracious heavens another idea presents	521.1668
He remembered those interesting stories	2996.2175
They are robbers perhaps he	19.5130
Just then the carriage rolled	117.8097
Danglars hazarded a look on	1241.4246
On the left in a	133.4383
It was Caracallas circus <PAD>	14.7151
On a word from the	119.4012
At the same time the	17.5347
Scendi exclaimed a commanding voice	13.8423
Danglars instantly descended although he	243.3044
More dead than alive he	30.0116
Four men surrounded him besides	26.4867
Di qu said one of	563.7162
Danglars followed his guide without	1210.5576
Still it appeared as though	434.1301
After walking for about ten	1340.1760
He wished to speak but	55.6092
Avanti said the same sharp	29.9493
This time Danglars had double	985.0112
This guide was our friend	2999.4568
Peppino stopped before a rock	2105.8560
The voice and gesture of	135.4770
There was no longer any	189.4898
Danglars acquitted himself like a	816.0132
Notwithstanding his large stomach certainly	2439.0703
As he touched the ground	27.1019
The path was wide but	20.7313
Peppino who cared little for	1014.4143
Two other men descended after	1769.0746
The walls were hollowed out	1415.7133
A sentinel struck the rings	110.4114
Who comes there he cried	11.4860
A friend a friend said	720.4235
Fine spoil captain fine spoil	1767.3234
Is this the man asked	296.5692
Himself captainhimself Very well show	1802.9801
His agitated features presented the	98.8581
The man is tired said	695.1300
The banker uttered a groan	284.8511
He no longer possessed strength	281.7185
At length he found himself	1043.6531
Then a low door was	954.7448
The cell was clean though	1107.1383
A bed of dried grass	209.5136
Danglars brightened up on beholding	266.2102
Oh God be praised he	619.3957
He had not done so	31.1867
Ecco said the guide and	183.7214
A bolt grated and Danglars	31.6954
If there had been no	680.7290
Danglars too had recognized the	982.9809
These recollections were dwelt upon	634.5034
Since the bandits had not	348.1281
They had arrested him for	718.4266
He remembered that Morcerf had	1433.7385
Eight thousand crowns amounted to	151.8075
With this sum he could	72.0312
Therefore tolerably secure in being	2412.6299

Luigi Vampas Bill of Fare	786.9771
He awoke <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0142
To a Parisian accustomed to	3536.0005
But in such a situation	438.7099
Yes yes he murmured I	809.6888
He borrowed this from Don	1177.6572
No he cried they have	832.3934
They were untouched the hundred	1716.6682
Singular bandits he exclaimed they	85.5972
As I was saying last	88.7581
Hello here is my watch	11.1147
Let me see what time	1043.0122
Without this Danglars would have	386.3741
Should he demand an explanation	449.6776
The last alternative seemed the	200.9378
During all this time a	422.2713
Danglars suddenly felt a strong	232.0047
He had noticed that a	1226.7007
Faugh he exclaimed retreating to	63.9232
At twelve this man was	1693.3530
He was an athletic gigantic	4009.0076
Ah ha cried Danglars this	1579.2963
May I be hanged said	1365.6400
But the mysteries of nature	2452.5989
Danglars felt his own not	1078.4362
Danglars knew that he was	53.3038
Che cosa asked the bandit	15.6502
Come come said Danglars tapping	682.6071
Danglars feelings were hurt and	1679.9277
Four hours passed by and	100.4025
Danglars who really began to	2801.3125
It was indeed Peppino who	1625.0004
Near the pan he also	1200.2679
Peppino was decidedly an epicure	16.4159
Danglars watched these preparations and	41.6521
Come he said to himself	751.4890
On y va coming exclaimed	4952.9712
Danglars immediately recognized him as	1042.2267
Then he added aloud Yes	2656.3870
Here you can get anything	1847.1294
Although in justice the people	936.6351
A bad reason replied Danglars	366.5352
Let me have some dinner	22.8678
What would your excellency like	1364.0774
Give your orders Have you	13650.4697
You mentioned a fowl I	3355.9885
I could almost believe myself	103.4106
Here your excellency said Peppino	1145.8571
Danglars asked for a knife	22.4803
Here excellency said Peppino offering	364.0191
Danglars took the knife in	493.8491
Pardon me excellency said Peppino	730.8810
They might not be satisfied	854.3137
Never mind Ill fix that	30.5581
I have always heard how	2564.8752
Peppino picked up the louis	158.0799
Stay a moment your excellency	1039.2313
Very droll he muttered very	2293.8362
Come now he said <PAD>	7.0506
Is it not a joke	16.8025
We never joke replied Peppino	71.4769

He was certainly eating and	115.5593
Brute said Danglars <PAD> <PAD>	6.1125
Peppino pretended not to hear	257.8272
Danglars stomach felt so empty	968.8701

Four thousand nine hundred and	892.0880
One hundred thousand francs for	268.2450

The Pardon The next day	1418.4072
The prisoner expected that he	1128.4429
But he had no sooner	158.7825
He struggled against his thirst	2347.0642
The sentinel opened the door	40.0019
He thought it would be	509.3502
Here I am your excellency	243.9419
What do you want Something	2422.8083
Oh water is even more	1767.9674

But you say you do	778.1212

Danglars raving threw himself on	31.8861
Who could these men be	11.4001
Who was the invisible chief	12.3412

And why when everyone else	239.6296

From this time the prisoner	207.9509
At the end of twelve	981.0812
Then a strange reaction took	1203.7161
He who for so long	1566.6281
Three days passed thus during	202.5883
Sometimes he was delirious and	1090.8405
On the fourth he was	81.0889
He had picked up every	1737.9708
Then he entreated Peppino as	1495.6163
But Peppino did not answer	13.5800
On the fifth day he	72.4988
Are you not a Christian	48.3282
Do you wish to assassinate	129.0472
Oh my former friends my	230.0569
Then rising in despair he	1503.5355
He struck his forehead on	37.7491

Of what must I repent	26.1512
Of the evil you have	23.7646

The Fifth of October It	3494.0784
The heat of the day	2411.0969
A delicious zephyr played along	4458.7817
A light yacht chaste and	3792.4246
The vessel resembled a swan	534.8416
It advanced swiftly and gracefully	305.0959
By degrees the sun disappeared	1636.0205
The yacht moved rapidly on	1627.5913
Standing on the prow was	1125.3762
Is that Monte Cristo asked	747.2949
Yes your excellency said the	744.9279
Then he added in a	837.1149

Ah yes he said as	43.7533
Give it to me The	952.3853
Ten minutes afterwards the sails	1285.2329
The gig was already lowered	228.9992
The traveller descended and instead	945.5828
The rowers waited their oars	1073.3337
Give way said the traveller	11.0805
The eight oars fell into	2917.2034
In an instant they found	1597.0045
Will your excellency be so	828.7470
Ah your excellency murmured the	964.4548
Thirty strides brought them to	1626.2507
Just as he turned a	954.2910

But you are dripping my	559.6158
Come I have a habitation	757.6441
Already the sound of their	148.6406
Oh yes said the count	563.2213
I have made an agreement	669.9861
I have made a bargain	67.8997
Count he said you are	769.9294
You are right to recall	485.5382
Oh how charitable kind and	1562.7775
Oh exclaimed Morrel with a	885.7089
Do you understand the meaning	20.2640
You can not take me	931.5117
When I ask you if	418.4535
Well Morrel let us both	72.1844
Do you still feel the	617.9702

Oh my dear friend if	1216.7679
Certainly there are people whom	19.5397
I love my sister JulieI	1980.6622
My sister would be bathed	412.7923
Emmanuel would tear the weapon	162.5403
You count who are more	919.7535
No I feel that I	140.6211
You told me to wait	171.9591
I waited a month or	69.5992
I did hope man is	89.1442
What I can not tellsomething	2081.2158
Yes I did waityes I	953.8938
Oh count I shall sleep	1303.2482
My friend continued Morrel you	943.0359
He felt a carpet under	1326.2311
Morrel hesitated to advance he	171.2527
Monte Cristo drew him in	16.4951
Why should we not spend	1610.8153
As you please he said	2448.7285
They were in the marvellous	2215.8262
Morrel had looked carelessly around	61.2055
Let us talk like men	45.8589
Go on Count said Morrel	804.6840
I am almost inclined to	914.3635
Yes he said yes doubtless	1771.7128
If you plunge a dagger	2895.3740
Some day when the world	1409.8302
Now I understand he said	573.5687
It was because you loved	642.2032
Not even me asked the	32.6888
Morrels clear eye was for	1847.4087
What said the count do	620.1451
I am endeavoring he thought	1055.4922
Now supposing I am deceived	446.5085
Alas what would become of	1527.6287
Count he said I swear	538.1154
I have accustomed myself to	817.7856
Morrel I possess nearly a	764.0263

Every career is open to	13.6804
Overturn the world change its	1842.4496
It is well said Monte	558.1767
Yes as you said you	161.3324
Sit down Morrel and wait	1475.2513
He placed the casket on	1100.7085
This box contained an unctuous	2560.4336
It was a mixed mass	59.7707
The count took out a	1079.4817
It was then observable that	46.8998
This is what you asked	321.9720
The count took another spoon	180.3621
What are you going to	83.9039
Well the fact is Morrel	946.5161
You who love and are	359.0506
In your case it would	22.8867
Adieu my noble and generous	841.8842
Then they were both silent	13.0882
Ali mute and attentive brought	100.8029
By degrees the light of	932.4702
Seated opposite to him Monte	497.6780
An overpowering sadness took possession	1745.3979
Friend he cried I feel	863.6779
Then it appeared to him	650.6483
At the same time the	1615.7817
Morrel overpowered turned around in	370.8430
A change of ideas presented	404.3681
Enervated prostrate and breathless he	2870.8630
He wished once again to	163.8067
He wished to articulate a	1520.1855
Involuntarily his languid eyes closed	2064.8286
The count had just opened	17.3865
Immediately a brilliant light from	896.4768
Then he saw a woman	563.5017
Pale and sweetly smiling she	537.8476
Is it heaven that opens	931.1222
Valentine Valentine he mentally ejaculated	1283.2065
Valentine rushed towards him his	34.5725
He is calling you said	769.4681
Happily I vanquished death <PAD>	10.9995
Henceforth Valentine you will never	516.2355

Hayde would it please you	522.6089

At length she felt his	2095.8672

Oh he cried in an	736.6032
Dearest exclaimed Valentine with her	2789.0437
The next morning at daybreak	2210.8340
They had found the door	1073.6024
Morrel soon perceived a man	1382.2695

CONCLUSION EPILOGUE AUTHORS PREFACE In	3709.9399
A short time ago while	3539.7590
The title attracted me I	498.6205
It is not my intention	1016.5468
They will therein find portraits	1585.9659
But it is well known	1101.0864
Now while admiring as others	2675.2241
DArtagnan relates that on his	1077.0779
We must confess these three	1504.5834
From that moment we had	1792.9553
The catalogue alone of the	1824.1774
It will suffice then to	1308.4238
and the Commencement of the	2330.7322
The discovery of a completely	2289.5208
We hastened therefore to obtain	2277.2664
This permission we feel bound	2034.5066
Now this is the first	1067.3434
In the meanwhile as the	739.3977
This being understood let us	52.0319
The Three Musketeers Chapter I	17.8170
THE THREE PRESENTS OF DARTAGNAN	9152.0547
Many citizens seeing the women	4208.0322
In those times panics were	3941.5801
There were nobles who made	993.1458
Then in addition to these	6070.5215
The citizens always took up	7339.7012
It resulted then from this	1311.9343
When arrived there the cause	69.5190
A young manwe can sketch	94.7355
Imagine to yourself a Don	2925.1792
Too big for a youth	1636.4215
For our young man had	124.1439
It was a Barn pony	2381.7708
Unfortunately the qualities of this	1621.0403
And this feeling had been	3004.0457
He had sighed deeply therefore	645.0027
He was not ignorant that	786.3270
My son said the old	456.1581
could never rid himself this	1173.9423
Never sell it allow it	1090.9711
At court provided you have	873.3501
By the latter I mean	35.4230
Endure nothing from anyone except	55.0065
It is by his courage	664.7018
Whoever hesitates for a second	2142.3091
You are young <PAD> <PAD>	6.2518
You ought to be brave	376.8113
Never fear quarrels but seek	28.1063
I have taught you how	565.7757
Fight on all occasions <PAD>	9.7205
Fight the more for duels	615.2664
I have nothing to give	549.0620
Your mother will add to	1101.0035
Take advantage of all and	36.0397
I have but one word	717.6100
Sometimes their play degenerated into	476.7288
The blows which he received	381.5822
Afterward Monsieur de Trville fought	1037.3044
So that in spite of	1060.6196
Still further Monsieur de Trville	716.8293
He began as you begin	11.5770
Go to him with this	453.6380
On leaving the paternal chamber	777.5196
The adieux were on this	1154.6519
DArtagnan was a woman and	24.2245
She wept abundantly andlet us	1581.5413
The same day the young	1380.1672
With such a vade mecum	3379.1245
Don Quixote took windmills for	3106.2725
It was not that the	1353.0801
DArtagnan then remained majestic and	901.6676
But there as he was	2299.7939
DArtagnan fancied quite naturally according	590.9013
This time DArtagnan was only	221.5793
The gentleman appeared to be	960.1589
Now as a halfsmile was	927.9238
Nevertheless DArtagnan was desirous of	297.2141
He fixed his haughty eye	1103.2849
He was dressed in a	1527.3409
This doublet and hose though	1998.1833
DArtagnan made all these remarks	1500.9088
Now as at the moment	603.3815
This time there could be	68.4283
Full then of this conviction	949.2261
Unfortunately as he advanced his	1145.7368
I say sir you sir	971.9662
The stranger looked at him	909.2492
His quiet manner and the	896.5837
DArtagnan seeing him approach drew	120.6831
This horse is decidedly or	1419.8763
It is a color very	1920.2922
I do not often laugh	820.2014
But DArtagnan was not of	559.3346
He drew his sword entirely	4030.1409
Why my good fellow you	1294.4320
What a godsend this would	2191.1829
The stranger then perceiving that	2208.5403
But at the same moment	1377.4092
This caused so rapid and	1783.4760
Replace him on his orange	1340.0432
Another gasconade murmured the gentleman	15.8953
By my honor these Gascons	33.3936
Keep up the dance then	43.2289
When he is tired he	485.4741
The fight was therefore prolonged	1585.8163
Another blow full upon his	1003.9561
It was at this moment	295.5769
The host fearful of consequences	1354.1063
As to the gentleman he	931.3668
Well how is it with	548.9549
Your Excellency is safe and	43.1952
Oh yes <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4088
Perfectly safe and sound my	621.6118
But before he fainted he	1161.1643
Oh no your Excellency he	982.1062
Now my dear host while	1077.6801
What was there in it	1124.1915
The latter rose from the	672.5118
The devil murmured he between	24.8053
Can Trville have set this	33.2113
He is very young but	831.5770
A weak obstacle is sometimes	156.1129
Host said he could you	246.4462
In conscience I can not	722.3588
Where is he In my	1330.6042
Has he taken off his	149.9607
But if he annoys you	129.5395
He causes a disturbance in	343.4774
Go make out my bill	1265.7253
Have they not obeyed me	1048.7109
Can he be afraid of	1343.3475
It is not necessary for	155.7881
She will soon pass she	30.4701
I had better get on	57.4297
I should like however to	1551.8451
We are well aware that	910.4375
But we find it thus	664.9073
In the meantime the host	460.4236
Giving him to understand that	1002.8160
DArtagnan half stupefied without his	1627.3368
His interlocutor whose head appeared	566.6456
We have already observed with	136.5089
He perceived then at a	729.6730
She was pale and fair	4176.8501
She was talking with great	37.9064
His Eminence then orders me	29.3202
To return instantly to England	818.8196
They are contained in this	574.3802
The stranger was about to	746.3017
This insolent boy chastises others	1270.9265
No before a woman you	1489.4993
The two interlocutors thus separated	185.6527
Pay him booby cried the	926.0646
Base coward <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0984
false gentleman cried DArtagnan springing	93.9586
But his wound had rendered	188.7318
Scarcely had he gone ten	1764.7609
coward <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8469
coward He is a coward	1556.9943
Yes a base coward murmured	502.3334
Milady faltered DArtagnan and fainted	32.3161
Ah its all one said	787.2919
There will be eleven crowns	1169.0099
The host had reckoned upon	1709.9120
On the following morning at	1467.5483
But when the time came	756.9861
The young man commenced his	1330.8105
My letter of recommendation cried	53.0295
or the holy blood I	2814.9021
Hence it resulted when DArtagnan	1619.4541
As to the rest of	700.8362
But this deception would probably	1337.3219
But after all said he	788.9199
In the first place I	520.1276
After the king and the	621.6456
There was to be sure	931.2105
Throwing down his spit and	997.7648
Does the letter contain anything	504.7927
Zounds <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8524
I think it does indeed	622.3679
It contained my fortune Bills	132.8992
Bills upon his Majestys private	2842.9883
The devil cried the host	42.9895
But its of no importance	198.8851
The money is nothing that	24.4293
I would rather have lost	876.7060
A ray of light all	521.3284
That letter is not lost	16.6083
What cried DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	6.4911
No it has been stolen	34.7514
By whom By the gentleman	36.6165
He came down into the	56.1140
He remained there some time	16.6113
I would lay a wager	1209.3005
The fact was that none	1089.2256
Do you say resumed DArtagnan	576.5656
When I informed him that	664.0483
I will complain to Monsieur	1458.3019
Thus the dealer to whom	678.5803
Thus DArtagnan entered Paris on	1686.9338
This chamber was a sort	499.6478
As soon as the earnest	895.8375
Next he went to the	848.7785
After this satisfied with the	974.7469
This sleep provincial as it	711.5270

THE ANTECHAMBER OF M DE	5607.4116
His insolent bravery his still	3111.2710
He was the friend of	816.3102
The father of M de	1310.7288
This was a great matter	413.9647
Thanks to this double gift	1267.1077
Thus Louis XIII <PAD> <PAD>	9.4816
had a real liking for	1410.8402
At that unhappy period it	486.3733
Many might take for their	1735.9094
Trville was one of these	12.6219
His was one of those	2004.9635
In short up to this	963.8318
At last Louis XIII <PAD>	12.8923
made Trville the captain of	104.5249
in devotedness or rather in	3688.7053
On his part the cardinal	64.6553
When he saw the formidable	104.0693
had surrounded himself this second	1061.0864
He had his Musketeers therefore	39.4296
had his and these two	1591.9485
It was not uncommon for	48.3327
to dispute over their evening	277.8228
Each boasted the bearing and	53.1998
While exclaiming loudly against duels	11938.5674
We learn this from the	823.8561
Trville had grasped the weak	498.2686
He paraded his Musketeers before	4193.7139
Trville understood admirably the war	750.0194
His soldiers formed a legion	455.7763
Loose halfdrunk imposing the kings	4932.1890
Thus M de Trville was	1404.1483
M de Trville employed this	786.3705
For the rest in the	1240.5393
In no instance let us	2920.5256
Endowed with a rare genius	1918.3647
Still further in spite of	1762.1843
The captain of the Musketeers	1094.4141
Louis XIV <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3760
absorbed all the smaller stars	2780.1660
In addition to the levees	649.2028
Among these two hundred levees	154.5898
The court of his htel	1760.7255
From fifty to sixty Musketeers	3472.6516
On one of those immense	3723.0469
In the antechamber upon long	704.2452
In this apartment a continued	2400.8472
The day on which DArtagnan	1525.6173
It is true that this	606.2364
When he had once passed	1358.2444
In order to make ones	1897.0786
It was then into the	1156.3914
When he had passed one	1018.7863
Arrived at the staircase it	22.1433
There were four Musketeers on	2386.8506
One of them stationed upon	1922.9238
These three others fenced against	99.0888
DArtagnan at first took these	2002.0813
He who at the moment	344.5681
A circle was formed around	19.2521
The conditions required that at	1741.7200
In five minutes three were	1081.4064
However difficult it might be	1858.6975
He had seen in his	2047.7158
He believed himself transported into	2619.8142
On the landing they were	1581.4290
On the landing DArtagnan blushed	52.7075
His warm and fickle imagination	3563.8970
But if his morals were	717.3309
There to his great astonishment	2004.5095
That great man who was	1070.5950
Some sang ballads about Mme	29.0469
dAguillon his mistress and Mme	14.7979
Cambalet his niece while others	2309.1431
Nevertheless when the name of	1003.1168

Certes these fellows will all	1179.3882
What would my good father	707.7776
Although he was a perfect	711.2393
At this demand DArtagnan gave	1722.0087
DArtagnan a little recovered from	400.4787
The center of the most	2239.5469
He did not wear the	3046.1248
A long cloak of crimson	4652.2910
This Musketeer had just come	1264.3760
It was for this reason	373.3318
What would you have said	16.8920
This fashion is coming in	12.6294
It is a folly I	65.7086
Besides one must lay out	2129.6582
It was given to you	1089.1804
Yes about in the same	1263.7329

This other Musketeer formed a	1134.9628
He was a stout man	2019.2603
His delicate mustache marked a	4142.0854
Habitually he spoke little and	1407.3597
He answered the appeal of	134.7760
This affirmation appeared to dispel	172.3041
They continued to admire it	578.5790
What do you think of	2428.8730
And what does he say	65.1588
He relates that he met	1118.5935
Indeed Why you knew it	23.1518
I told you of it	12.6930
Let us say no more	79.4510

What a misfortune it is	873.9508
You very well know Porthos	969.8810

What is he waiting for	17.2627
Only till the queen has	1291.9722

Oh good Lord <PAD> <PAD>	7.6908
Dont trouble yourself to reveal	1474.2197
But since you possess that	826.8566
Let whoever likes talk of	720.7111

As to you good sir	293.6046

When the two Musketeers had	835.4764

And why so asked Porthos	20.5260
Because he plainly perceives that	3596.6064
The two Musketeers reddened to	67.7217
DArtagnan did not know where	135.7024

DArtagnan looked for some tapestry	2180.0608
Well my Captain said Porthos	355.1941
But we were not captured	1069.2771
For you know Athos <PAD>	7.5857
Well Captain he endeavored twice	127.9576
And we did not surrenderno	13.9049
They dragged us away by	21.0868
On the way we escaped	10.8893
As for Athos they believed	759.7902
Thats the whole story <PAD>	9.0417
What the devil Captain one	105.5762
The great Pompey lost that	1136.4287
Killed him or poniarded him	715.1277
The cardinal exaggerated as I	2544.8777
He would be in despair	370.1492
Athos cried the two Musketeers	12.2654
Athos repeated M de Trville	20.9129
You have sent for me	847.7758
I am here what do	1533.5192
M de Trville moved to	481.5771
I was about to say	1249.3322
Your hand Athos And without	1122.7687
The door had remained open	1169.3628
A burst of satisfaction hailed	1239.3231
M de Trville was about	1135.1219

But all this eager attention	1146.6310
He pushed through the crowd	2282.8906
Immediately M de Trville opened	826.3033
Behind this group walked the	124.0383

When all had gone out	741.2616
The event which had occurred	225.7217
He inquired what was the	44.9776
DArtagnan then repeated his name	650.9045
Pardon me said he smiling	241.5255
But what help is there	16.6071
A captain is nothing but	733.6786
Soldiers are big children but	556.5449

I respected your father very	26.6944
What can I do for	13.7543
Tell me quickly my time	977.1473
But his majestys decision is	1228.3829
But continued M de Trville	1186.6770
Our recruits from Barn are	1340.7264
I dare say you have	726.7230
I know these airs I	1245.4612
Thanks to the sale of	1362.0294
You ought I say then	694.7681
I will write a letter	1040.6298
Do not refuse this little	16.9546
Our bestborn and richest gentlemen	349.0548
You will learn horsemanship swordsmanship	161.0083
You will make some desirable	885.0563
Alas sir said he I	852.7468
This is all very strange	1588.9575
A name like yours must	122.0756
Judge if I should not	1842.4611
He could not refrain from	1056.5507
If I ever find him	847.7378
He departed immediately after having	1174.6680
I believed him still at	655.0719
I will then release you	1359.5974
If you see him coming	137.0076
Do not cast yourself against	1108.3823
This great hatred which the	5062.2666
Might not this young man	41.9696
Might he not have come	102.9680
This pretended DArtagnanwas he not	1751.4349
He fixed his eyes upon	81.3877
He was moderately reassured however	1164.9166
I know he is a	357.3752
Let us try him My	1014.5062
The king and the cardinal	972.8575
I am not willing that	1720.7126
Be assured that I am	1979.8794
Now young man regulate your	1793.9011
I will aid you in	160.3894
I hope that my frankness	464.0595
Therefore in spite of all	951.6862
DArtagnan answered with the greatest	183.8536
My father advised me to	1457.7457
I have the greatest veneration	367.2839
So much the better for	421.1667
But I still trust you	640.9174
So much penetration so much	562.3169
The more this young man	685.1837
Nevertheless he pressed DArtagnans hand	653.2188
My htel will be always	27.6651
Hereafter being able to ask	1008.1590
Well be assured added he	719.3580
But wait a minute said	65.8981
I promised you a letter	55.5093
Are you too proud to	710.6335
While he was doing this	1196.7550
M de Trville after having	970.2890
But at the very moment	905.6357
He my thief replied DArtagnan	12.6065
Ah the traitor and he	13.6356
The devil take the madman	2076.8201
THE SHOULDER OF ATHOS THE	26868.5918
Excuse me said DArtagnan endeavoring	989.8302
You are in a hurry	97.2230
Under that pretense you run	23.3188
You say Excuse me and	40.9545
Not at all my young	11.8960
Do you fancy because you	1272.8679
Undeceive yourself comrade you are	2179.3521
I did not do it	875.8719
I repeat to you however	1095.0645
Leave your hold then I	892.7680
Morbleu monsieur said he however	570.5499
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
If I were not in	219.0977
Monsieur Maninahurry you can find	2285.2517
That will do I will	834.6605
But at the street gate	97.1447
Between the two talkers there	115.1191
DArtagnan thought it would suffice	319.5634
But DArtagnan had reckoned without	22.4724
As he was about to	1246.4111
Without doubt Porthos had reasons	1204.5739
DArtagnan hearing the Musketeer swear	1271.2078
He was particularly anxious to	2456.6792
Alas like most things in	1370.2510
Vainglorious as he was Porthos	650.2404
One could comprehend the necessity	106.2525
Bless me cried Porthos making	1312.7552
No replied DArtagnan piqued and	1177.2239
Porthos foamed with rage and	120.6303
Presently presently cried the latter	1694.1914
But neither in the street	785.4860
DArtagnan inquired of everyone he	941.6829
This chase was however advantageous	1311.4620
He began to reflect upon	214.6066
It was scarcely eleven oclock	890.0035
Besides this he had drawn	2612.7581
The outlook was sad <PAD>	12.2836
Sure of being killed by	680.0126
As hope however is the	973.1210
That brave and unfortunate Athos	1757.2906
The only thing that astonishes	228.5708
He had good cause to	199.8541
As to Porthosoh as to	1091.3140
As to Porthos that is	216.5113
Are people to be run	35.5288
No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8453
And have I any right	332.1767
He would have pardoned me	565.8475
Ah cursed Gascon that I	146.5383
Friend DArtagnan continued he speaking	615.2719
You must henceforth be admired	125.4661
To be obliging and polite	164.4674
Look at Aramis now Aramis	78.6385
Well did anybody ever dream	77.8882
No certainly not and from	166.9920
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
Thats strange <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5654
Here he is DArtagnan walking	1142.2739
DArtagnan on the contrary quite	1206.9456
All four besides immediately broke	47.0567
DArtagnan was not so dull	518.1971
He was seeking in his	840.3893
This appeared to be a	90.8185
He stooped and with the	1247.5564
Aramis blushed excessively and snatched	297.8322
Ah ah cried one of	1012.9478
Then resuming his mild air	1291.2738
This time DArtagnan was not	15.0243
He perceived his mistake but	580.8413
If it were as you	633.9258
He had his foot upon	424.5617
Then turning toward that one	782.3931
You are about to swear	555.6979
Now here Montaran we will	2411.4946
Aramis you certainly are full	1036.5767
In a moment or two	1991.5361
Now is my time to	833.9285
What the devil <PAD> <PAD>	6.1871
Paris is not paved with	1416.7438
I am from Gascony it	702.0945
Thank God I am not	18.9034
And being a Musketeer but	622.0341
Why did you so maladroitly	1191.8671
Well I will teach you	1751.3522
Draw if you please and	425.7241
Do you not perceive that	470.0050
How do I know that	630.2896
Now I entertain a ridiculous	611.4622
I wish to kill you	826.8984
Take your handkerchief whether it	713.1530
Yes <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8439
Monsieur does not postpone an	4469.0840
At two oclock I shall	328.9416
There I will indicate to	798.6619
He went therefore to his	1131.7997
Besides his intention was formed	3255.3982
Now we must have badly	1972.8651
He reflected upon the different	939.7183
He hoped by means of	2335.4001
He flattered himself he should	893.7242
As to the astute Aramis	962.9705
In addition to this DArtagnan	1294.9871
When DArtagnan arrived in sight	929.8040
He was then as punctual	1799.8397
Athos who still suffered grievously	3222.4033
Monsieur said Athos I have	610.0712
You know no one but	44.6410
Yes monsieur I know only	638.3484
But I will take the	103.7112
Do not fancy that I	125.2808
And it will be even	861.2277
I regret I did not	1651.5454
Ah sblood how you have	27.9532
My shoulder quite burns If	188.9079
What monsieur I have a	1043.6376
Pardieu monsieur said Athos thats	931.6573
Thus spoke and acted the	1864.9404
Unfortunately we do not live	360.8767
I think these fellows will	935.3854
That did not come from	32.6712
Monsieur I love men of	1557.9344
We will wait for these	546.1031
Ah here is one of	834.6661
What cried DArtagnan is your	1041.3837
What cried he in an	633.9896
Are you not aware that	619.6728
And yet as you come	249.4555
It is probable you are	71.9362
My faith replied DArtagnan you	1167.8259
Let us say in passing	232.5701
Ah ah said he what	807.1081
Why it is with him	64.9228
But not before one oclock	18.2589
And I also am to	387.5617
But not until two oclock	52.6497
But what are you going	51.1900
Faith <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8458
I dont very well know	12.5391
He hurt my shoulder <PAD>	11.7027
And you Porthos Faith <PAD>	9.6901
I am going to fightbecause	164.9923
Athos whose keen eye lost	1818.8435
Oh ours is a theological	1324.9246
Athos indeed saw a second	47.5959
Indeed said Athos <PAD> <PAD>	6.0275
Yes a passage of St	203.0587
Decidedly this is a clever	28.2907
And now you are assembled	1505.2550
You do not understand me	798.8865
I asked to be excused	932.7575
And now gentlemen I repeat	1769.9479
The blood had mounted to	478.3727
It was a quarter past	19.8640
The sun was in its	1019.6713
It is very hot said	1004.0418
I will therefore fight in	519.1248
Remember we are waiting for	1676.0551
For my part I think	739.4686
I waited your orders said	37.6746
But scarcely had the two	2125.8159
The cardinals Guards cried Aramis	65.3374
Sheathe your swords gentlemen sheathe	133.8320
The two combatants had been	275.3299
Halloo cried Jussac advancing toward	1184.4242
Fighting here are you <PAD>	7.4096
And the edicts <PAD> <PAD>	7.3003
What is become of them	1272.2993
If we were to see	466.1633
Leave us alone then and	1450.3042
Duty before everything <PAD> <PAD>	7.4077
Sheathe then if you please	1797.4862
Pass on your way then	352.3372
We will charge upon you	816.3569
This short interval was sufficient	175.6982
It was one of those	453.6350
To fight that was to	524.0550
All this the young man	458.3019
Turning towards Athos and his	392.5902
You said you were but	348.0797
Thats true replied DArtagnan I	83.6061
My heart is that of	1336.8323
You may retire we consent	21.0986
Save your skin begone quickly	74.6613
Decidedly you are a brave	98.2369
Come come choose your part	31.8490
Well said Porthos to Aramis	186.6795
But all three reflected upon	129.4581
We should only be three	601.7180
That is difficult replied Athos	11.9554
DArtagnan comprehended their irresolution <PAD>	15.2190
Try me gentlemen said he	396.2830
DArtagnan monsieur Well then Athos	84.8082
Come gentlemen have you decided	68.4511
It is done gentlemen said	14.1478
And what is your choice	26.7232
We are about to have	666.0592
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
You resist do you cried	20.3710
Sblood does that astonish you	2006.9990
Athos fixed upon a certain	77.3591
Porthos had Bicarat and Aramis	97.9911
As to DArtagnan he sprang	31.9783
The heart of the young	1209.8992
Jussac was as was then	819.0719
This contest at length exhausted	53.3434
Furious at being held in	941.4423
DArtagnan who though wanting in	232.9882
Jussac anxious to put an	1983.9214
Jussac fell like a dead	18.2760
DArtagnan then cast an anxious	147.5925
Aramis had killed one of	113.7163
Nevertheless Aramis was in a	69.9468
Bicarat and Porthos had just	23.2107
Porthos had received a thrust	216.7178
But neither of these two	214.8056
Athos wounded anew by Cahusac	484.0088
He only changed his sword	84.7008
According to the laws of	435.1307
While he was endeavoring to	848.4985
The glance was of sublime	19.4639
Athos would have died rather	646.1663
DArtagnan interpreted it with a	1656.2465
It was time for Athos	285.8014
Sblood cried he to DArtagnan	91.0448
I have an old affair	231.1208
Disarm him onlymake sure of	23.4240
Thats it <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.6478
Very well done The exclamation	1301.3090
DArtagnan and Cahusac sprang forward	717.3445
Cahusac immediately ran to the	1241.2517
DArtagnan perceived that it would	903.4903
At the same instant Aramis	842.4809
There only then remained Porthos	24.9854
Porthos made a thousand flourishes	2242.3101
Bicarat was one of those	60.6523
Nevertheless it was necessary to	14.7253
The watch might come up	468.0166
Athos Aramis and DArtagnan surrounded	88.4383
Though alone against all and	1731.7343
Bicarat was a Gascon as	1094.3358
As you are my commander	1717.4935
Bravery is always respected even	32.5627
The Musketeers saluted Bicarat with	269.0042
DArtagnan did the same <PAD>	7.4684
Then assisted by Bicarat the	2852.3357
The fourth as we have	22.9110
They then rang the bell	1947.5779
They walked arm in arm	1608.4851
The heart of DArtagnan swam	460.9719
If I am not yet	592.8026
HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII	37.3922
This affair made a great	17.1768
M de Trville scolded his	1532.3964
It was already too late	12.8103
The king was closeted with	756.3965
In the evening M de	109.5856
The king was winning and	251.2806
Perceiving M de Trville at	1147.4814
Do you know that his	1219.9080
Ah these Musketeers of yours	2058.4004
And that is that their	313.0526
But what are they to	11.1718
The Guards of Monsieur the	1027.9314
Would not one say he	60.4992
In truth my dear Captain	750.5052
But dont fancy that I	122.6592
I am called Louis the	827.5789
The king therefore arose a	1197.3960
Ah I had eighty louis	865.7838
Justice before everything Then turning	1654.0847
Let us see for you	510.2262
In the most simple and	30.8816
Three of my best soldiers	1448.7539
The party was to take	983.1403
You incline me to think	27.0209
There is no doubt they	1361.9404
But all this will come	117.0857
You say then that the	852.9615
You know how difficult it	1102.1759
to be named the Just	363.8879
They had a youth with	709.1803
Tell me how Trvilleyou know	718.3560
twisted his mustache proudly placing	90.0450
Sire resumed Trville as I	581.3398
The Guards of the cardinal	956.3828
They called upon him then	770.7611
Well he did remain with	592.6333
Trville thats impossible It is	701.6441
I wish to thank them	24.4727
Devoted men are so rare	61.7404
It is useless to let	2228.8201
It is a brawl and	922.4028
That evening the three Musketeers	101.4563
As they had long been	819.8979
By eight oclock in the	58.4180
DArtagnan found the Musketeer dressed	50.1774
As the hour to wait	472.9185
Athos invited DArtagnan to follow	1058.0560
The two Musketeers were already	64.5922
Athos who was very expert	1341.0077
DArtagnan remained therefore alone and	865.0364
But one of these balls	1369.3124
Now as upon this audience	2095.7554
Unfortunately for DArtagnan among the	1328.8105
He believed this opportunity was	944.4567
Pardieu resumed the latter twisting	506.0657
I have said what I	388.1598
At once if you please	98.5388
I am completely ignorant nor	1539.2004
You must be aware that	1302.0060
Indeed the name of Bernajoux	658.7588
Porthos and Aramis were so	729.3603
An instant after the Guardsman	44.9173
As DArtagnan had no time	544.0970
It is fortunate for you	892.3671
Never mind be content I	34.5923
On guard But said he	961.8402
On guard then monsieur on	825.4058
In an instant his sword	1290.1832
But DArtagnan had on the	54.1274
Fresh sharpened by his victory	1003.3804
So the two swords were	927.0923
He freed his weapon made	233.7990
DArtagnan immediately made a step	1672.9108
As however he did not	1305.2794
But Athos Porthos and Aramis	1275.1180
Bernajoux now fell and as	621.9059
The Htel de la Trmouille	1831.5005
Thus the soldiers of other	1354.6792
Of three Guardsmen of the	1014.6213
To the rescue As usual	1170.2698
The mle became general but	128.5871
The cardinals Guards and M	2045.1388
As to the wounded man	311.7593
Excitement was at its height	1476.8434
The proposition had been made	266.7038
DArtagnan and his companions remembered	1065.8588
They soon tired of the	17.3435
Besides those who must be	1132.9719
Quick to the Louvre said	581.6346
We will describe the thing	467.9233
M de Trville required this	1396.5641
Had his Majesty asked he	2598.2903
At first the king answered	575.8929
In all probability he has	821.0153
Gentlemen I will see the	409.1364
M de Trville recommended everyone	137.1774
On entering his htel M	473.7990
He sent one of his	564.3611
But M de la Trmouillealready	3758.7297
Now as the debate between	2179.2656
This was to go himself	46.4758
He repaired therefore immediately to	151.4960
The two nobles saluted each	1743.3643
Both were men of courage	1274.4111
This time however his address	119.7226
Monsieur said M de Trville	671.3059
In addition to the sword	1134.4618
Let us adjure him in	526.8236
I will take him for	685.6337
Both descended to the chamber	46.7997
The latter on seeing these	1481.8787
M de la Trmouille approached	648.4393
Then M de Trville unwilling	1271.6545
That happened which M de	39.5033
Placed between life and death	666.9990
This was all that M	28.9794
He wished Bernajoux a speedy	3656.0715
M de Trville entertained good	116.8777
It may easily be understood	921.6172
Now as DArtagnan had been	755.7159
Toward six oclock M de	568.9752
The king had not yet	29.9754
Our young men had been	1454.4664
At his announcement DArtagnan felt	182.0259
The coming instant would in	122.4552
His eyes therefore were fixed	471.2071
Louis XIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3746
appeared walking fast <PAD> <PAD>	9.3608
He was in hunting costume	975.5727
At the first glance DArtagnan	110.4829
This disposition visible as it	1862.3838
In royal antechambers it is	1133.3258
The three Musketeers therefore did	124.2574
DArtagnan on the contrary remained	1008.2032
As for M de Trville	594.5725
Matters go but badly said	1184.4988
M de Trville entered the	2586.7021
This however did not prevent	353.1518
Bad monsieur bad replied the	1630.3029
Your Majesty is bored <PAD>	13.1060
Have you not enjoyed the	315.8639
Upon my soul everything degenerates	1572.1254
We started a stag of	29.1268
We chased him for six	2633.3669
I shall be obliged to	198.6397
Ah I am an unfortunate	43.7725
I had but one gerfalcon	994.5879
The misfortune is great but	1974.6016
Falconers are declining <PAD> <PAD>	8.4665
I know no one but	192.9024
After me it will all	408.2688
If I had but the	31.5583
But there is the cardinal	776.4259
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
propos of the cardinal Monsieur	855.1007
He knew the king of	905.5748
And in what have I	1454.4089
Is it thus you perform	914.1478
Is it for this I	820.0129
But yet continued the king	1819.2599
Against calumniators said M de	23.1590
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
This is something new replied	18.1159
Will you tell me that	1352.9000
Will you tell me that	835.7421
Tell me now can you	890.7155
Who has told me this	32.2250
Who should it be but	1821.0764

Arrived at the foot of	74.3486
If the king was still	1053.9220
On arriving at the kings	1848.2123
This circumstance pleased M de	3991.6987
In fact ten minutes had	1161.1671
The duke came straight up	989.7084

It is nearly eight oclock	88.7874
Go Monsieur Duke and return	18.7909
Come in Trville The Duke	43.3976
At the moment he opened	818.5897
Come in my braves said	1189.6838
What the devil continued the	12.3139
Seven of his Eminences Guards	394.2548
Thats too many gentlemen too	20.2584
If you go on so	814.4785
One now and then I	679.3081
Hem said the king <PAD>	6.7702
I place no confidence in	44.8248
In particular there is one	49.2322
Come hither monsieur DArtagnan who	1771.8766
Why you told me he	20.2132
This is a boy Trville	35.8846
Do you mean to say	1314.3788
Ventresaintgris Monsieur de Trville as	62.3581
But at this sort of	419.9018
Now Gascons are always poor	2006.3981
Well happily I dont say	31.5668
La Chesnaye go and see	1577.7224
And now let us see	788.1077
This is all very well	488.4530
Poor cardinal <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.3619
Seven men in two days	45.8879
But thats quite enough gentlemen	84.0635
You have taken your revenge	1677.9871
Here said he is a	810.7057
A gentleman received from hand	432.1372
DArtagnan put his forty pistoles	955.9250
There said the king looking	698.0516
Thanks for your devotedness gentlemen	14.5058
I may continue to rely	970.8509
Trville added the king in	609.9028
Ah pardieu Trville <PAD> <PAD>	10.6682
I enjoy beforehand the face	39.2511
He will be furious but	27.7679
I am doing what is	1316.9836
The cardinal as his Majesty	1378.1713
This did not prevent the	1127.8329
THE INTERIOR OF THE MUSKETEERS	2133.3191
The repast was carried into	233.6452
The repast had been ordered	121.5010
He was a Picard whom	3500.6624
Porthos pretended that this occupation	1632.7660
The noble carriage of this	911.7882
He felt a slight disappointment	1430.0352
Nevertheless when he waited at	669.5160
He preserved this opinion even	1633.8204
The bed was the only	196.0289
Planchet slept in the antechamber	594.9046
Athos on his part had	843.7590
He was very taciturn this	33.2457
Be it understood we are	23.4321
During the five or six	827.0416
His words were brief and	2045.0266
His conversation was a matter	72.3277
Although Athos was scarcely thirty	1263.4871
He never spoke of women	12.9467
He certainly did not prevent	1038.7062
His reserve his roughness and	146.4276
He had then in order	1115.7738
He never spoke to him	82.5197
Sometimes Grimaud who feared his	1307.9960
Athos then shrugged his shoulders	244.2345
On these days he spoke	19.4577
Porthos as we have seen	100.2957
He not only talked much	2707.3127
He talked for the pleasure	161.9360
He spoke upon all subjects	2937.6519
He had not so noble	1294.6808
But with his simple Musketeers	715.8974
Porthos consoled himself by filling	1015.7585
An old proverb says Like	1311.9994
Mousqueton was a Norman whose	2637.7932
He had entered the service	877.4529
Porthos agreed to the bargain	90.4478
He had doublets cut out	2154.6377
As for Aramis of whom	1024.9180
Thanks to the hopes which	1613.6936
He was a Berrichon thirtyfive	3807.7688
For the rest he was	170.7135
And now that we are	732.5233
Athos dwelt in the Rue	126.5815
His apartment consisted of two	2249.1240
Some fragments of past splendor	2271.7046
It had long been an	47.1337
Porthos would have given ten	96.2998
One day when he had	372.0804
Athos without saying anything emptied	4566.2119
In addition to the sword	977.1719
Besides these a casket of	1345.2026
Athos always carried the key	645.5461
Porthos lived in an apartment	782.3088
Every time he passed with	430.6157
As to Aramis he dwelt	1155.5381
With regard to DArtagnan we	1224.8331
DArtagnan who was by nature	1519.2732
He addressed himself then to	897.7104
Unfortunately Porthos knew nothing of	198.0632
It was said Athos had	1136.8607
What could this treachery be	13.1483
All the world was ignorant	15.0543
As to Porthos except his	609.4498
Vain and indiscreet it was	165.1389
The only thing to mislead	629.3190
With respect to Aramis though	732.1758
And you my dear companion	1139.9065
But be assured my dear	889.0581
The handkerchief you saw had	455.6394
I was obliged to pick	338.1329
As for myself I neither	959.4262
You are not a priest	786.5940
Athos and Porthos dragged me	41.9981
I had at the moment	799.2935
Then I must go to	847.8275
So you see my dear	408.0385
Notwithstanding all the pains he	590.7264
He formed therefore the resolution	854.4739
In the meanwhile he looked	762.7894
As to the rest the	93.2602
Athos played and that as	31.2818
Nevertheless he never borrowed a	970.2793
Porthos had his fits <PAD>	9.6419
On the days when he	1256.7957
As to Aramis he never	14.5097
He was the worst Musketeer	131.2083
He had always something or	22.5993
Sometimes in the midst of	910.1007
At other times he would	637.3751
At this Athos would smile	1643.8129
Planchet DArtagnans valet supported his	56.8850
He received thirty sous per	2637.0940
When the wind of adversity	1056.9578
were consumed or nearly sohe	1502.4534
Athos counseled DArtagnan to dismiss	923.4110
This is all very easy	515.3852
It is with valets as	882.0855
Reflect upon it DArtagnan did	1491.4573
After having well beaten him	231.6239
For added he the future	386.5853
Your fortune is therefore made	453.4499
Planchet was equally seized with	115.6196
The life of the four	50.6319
DArtagnan who had no settled	753.9882
They rose about eight oclock	1121.2765
DArtagnan although he was not	239.6579
He went on guard because	416.2882
He was well known at	398.8010
M de Trville who had	1799.0383
On their side the three	156.8869
The friendship which united these	1144.2430
In the meanwhile the promises	116.1126
One fine morning the king	2267.1121
DArtagnan with a sigh donned	924.9235
But M de Trville promised	4028.2388
Upon this promise DArtagnan withdrew	78.8374
Then it became the turn	443.7677
The company of M le	688.1292
Chapter VIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6396
CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE In	3121.2000
At first Athos supported the	105.6963
Porthos succeeded him and thanks	650.3728
At last it became Aramiss	1551.8511
Then as they had been	997.7419
At length when they found	1218.8624
Unfortunately he was in a	824.3580
Then the inconvenience became distress	16.7904
The hungry friends followed by	5720.9043
Athos was invited four times	233.2924
Porthos had six occasions and	921.8431
He was a man as	690.0583
As to DArtagnan who as	760.6907
He took his army to	1320.1676
He fancied himself a burden	2071.1812
He reflected that this coalition	2665.5850
In fact four men such	2012.8185
The only thing that astonished	113.8133
He was thinking by himself	1653.3403
DArtagnan awakened Planchet and ordered	35.3498
From this phrase DArtagnan awakened	980.0688
No it had just struck	15.2383
Planchet two hours before had	656.8626
A man was introduced of	150.6649
Planchet by way of dessert	764.2038
DArtagnan dismissed Planchet and requested	65.8659
There was a moment of	627.6010
I have heard Monsieur dArtagnan	718.3787
The citizen made a fresh	804.2023
I was induced to marry	1686.4755
Well resumed the citizen well	1825.8483
It is you who have	15.2056
It is you who have	107.4470
Act then as you think	913.5847
I believe then that it	654.1445
Can it be on account	561.0500
Higher monsieur higher Of Madame	7335.1880
Yes monsieur replied the terrified	302.9104
And with whom With whom	837.1349
But how do you know	217.0372
No halfconfidence oryou understand I	3849.8474
Did I not tell you	281.7065
Well Monsieur Laporte placed her	1490.7847
It begins to develop itself	28.3933
Now my wife came home	56.2642
One of her conditions was	468.6928
The cardinal as it appears	157.9596
He can not pardon her	43.7706
You know the history of	1163.7701
So that now it is	1240.7771
But your wife monsieur what	628.6873
No I am wrong <PAD>	8.7786
On the contrary that simplifies	33.4109
If your man is mine	1110.5974
One day as I was	572.7988
The devil murmured DArtagnan all	44.8014
From whom have you learned	1465.6705
Besides by the faith of	164.1024
Yes that is my name	73.2516
Pardon me for interrupting you	428.2923
I am your landlord Ah	960.4905
And as it is three	655.5435
A letter said the young	11.5105
Which I received this morning	524.0065
The citizen followed him <PAD>	11.1073
Do not seek your wife	800.0119
If you make a single	1147.3108
I am not a fighting	492.6869
I have no greater regard	54.4137
If it were nothing but	1330.5288
You are rich then my	2318.5134
What demanded DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	7.5713
Whom do I see yonder	1663.4458
Ah this time cried DArtagnan	879.6045
On the staircase he met	88.4509
They separated and DArtagnan rushed	68.3073
Pah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8473
Where are you going cried	51.6224
The man of Meung replied	27.0717
DArtagnan had more than once	538.0890
The opinion of Athos was	94.9639
A gentleman in his opinionand	1300.8560
Porthos saw nothing in all	708.8321
Aramis said that as these	293.0296
They understood then from the	577.6176
When they entered DArtagnans chamber	1315.5494
Chapter IX <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.4694
DARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF As Athos	745.0284
He had again missed his	118.0301
DArtagnan had run sword in	1307.6024
Then he came back to	428.4680
While DArtagnan was running through	1473.3398
Well cried the three Musketeers	1482.7438
Well cried he throwing his	673.5256
I never believe in anything	641.5314
As to Athos faithful to	572.8151
Planchet said DArtagnan to his	1071.7340
You have credit with your	38.6123
Yes replied DArtagnan from this	659.5829
I always said that DArtagnan	566.3382
But come what is this	22.6666
Yes said Aramis impart it	1261.3518
Your affair is not bad	1215.5055
Then there only remains to	2743.2515
You grow a little too	276.3401
Woman was created for our	1456.6500
It is not Madame Bonacieux	883.9314
As to the second reproach	590.3898
I never saw a man	1779.8186
I was at the Louvre	715.1062
Do you know him Aramis	479.1094
I was at school at	518.9439
What for demanded Porthos <PAD>	9.4421
Go on while I endeavor	1043.2659
I like to hear him	1581.7909
Yesterday I was at the	756.3298
He resides in a quiet	292.6244
Now at the moment when	75.1392
Well cried his auditors at	924.5989
This doctor has a niece	25.7367
Ah he has a niece	23.6442
A very respectable lady said	20.5959
The three friends burst into	22.6707
Ah if you laugh if	919.5207
I will continue then resumed	18.5097
This niece comes sometimes to	802.1051
She has a carriage then	1089.7025
A nice acquaintance my friend	737.1542
Let us try not to	35.9973
Go on Aramis go on	1213.4808
Possibly continued Aramis came toward	1255.7191
I believe so replied Aramis	11.8031
But the lady asked Porthos	11.1032
He took her for the	18.0616
Just so replied Aramis <PAD>	8.4718
The Gascon is the devil	815.9856
In the month of July	12.1556
The devil said Porthos <PAD>	8.9173
Is the doctor afraid that	675.8333
Oh good lord cried Porthos	1396.0055
Let us separate and let	1842.7537
Can you believe so said	79.6690
She is goddaughter to Laporte	68.0641
Have I not told you	15.4612
Besides it has perhaps been	728.2854
High heads expose themselves from	1611.2217
Save me gentlemen for the	60.7018
There are four men come	25.8746
Save me <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.7085
Save me Porthos and Aramis	14.1977
A moment cried DArtagnan making	425.3053
It is not courage that	922.1799
He has I repeat the	632.3400
Do as you think best	761.6282
Come in gentlemen come in	476.7989
On the contrary gentlemen we	519.6519
You are a simpleton said	14.3989
Silence But you promised me	47.5884
We can only save you	1397.3214
I saw him today for	434.1895
Is that not true Monsieur	18.5874
Answer That is the very	1003.0747
Come come gentlemen remove the	2001.9180
You come to demand money	60.2492
To prison with him <PAD>	8.4782
Gentlemen once more take him	801.9517
As they were going down	177.9406
May I not drink to	926.6738
That will do me great	1355.4080
What is your name in	1072.6700
What diabolical villainy you have	1334.0660
Shame shame for four Musketeers	1177.5410
And a gentleman to hobnob	903.4696
DArtagnan you are a great	815.5768
Hold out your hand and	63.2759
Overcome by example grumbling to	994.5737
Now let us everyone retire	771.4240
For from this moment we	117.1431
A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH	10183.8994
As perhaps our readers are	1274.0381
When in a house of	982.9655
Four or five men are	75.0175
The door is opened to	24.3113
It is closed after them	500.4919
And that is a mousetrap	11.9340
The apartment of M Bonacieux	1977.8431
It must be observed that	996.9193
Besides nobody came thither but	1957.6111
Athos had even gone so	1683.7346
But M de Trville knew	532.6088
But this last circumstance was	800.3782
M de Trville requested Athos	1223.0048
As to DArtagnan he did	40.7993
He converted his chamber into	33.6894
From his windows he saw	58.2744
Then having removed a plank	1322.7435
The interrogatories preceded by a	8122.7515
Has Monsieur Bonacieux sent anything	201.7624
Has either of them confided	1180.0519
Now what is it they	18.6055
Why they want to know	526.1345
In the meantime the mousetrap	172.6020
On the evening of the	607.4670
The door was instantly opened	137.3342
DArtagnan flew to his hole	300.9290
Cries were soon heard and	259.8264
There were no questions <PAD>	9.6753
The devil said DArtagnan to	12.9314
It seems like a woman	12.0905
They search her she resists	3658.4746
But I tell you that	50.9933
I tell you I am	376.3654
Madame Bonacieux murmured DArtagnan <PAD>	12.5218
Can I be so lucky	1005.0803
The victim resisted as much	136.4720
Pardon gentlemenpar murmured the voice	238.3075
They are binding her they	872.1495
My sword <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4835
Good it is by my	11.9210
Planchet Monsieur Run and seek	42.5527
One of the three will	62.8228
Tell them to take arms	43.0322
Ah I remember Athos is	853.4432
You put back the boards	938.2971
Monsieur <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8457
You will kill yourself cried	18.2869
Hold your tongue stupid fellow	1447.4736
He then went straight to	886.4708
Then those who dwelt in	4174.1821
A moment after those who	882.6742
DArtagnan was conquerorwithout much effort	1238.9999
It is true that the	1334.4307
Ten minutes sufficed for their	243.0495
The neighbors who had opened	1240.3169
Besides it began to grow	921.6242
On being left alone with	21.6868
Bonacieux DArtagnan turned toward her	793.3582
DArtagnan examined her with a	23.3998
She was a charming woman	2131.7146
There however ended the signs	249.2316
The hands were white but	378.0200
Happily DArtagnan was not yet	44.9794
While DArtagnan was examining Mme	16.7316
Bonacieux and was as we	492.6512
From that time DArtagnan had	645.0826
Bonacieux the one he had	21.9827
At that moment Mme <PAD>	11.0722
Bonacieux recovered her senses <PAD>	11.5660
She opened her eyes looked	620.4794
She extended her hands to	27.9328
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
Bonacieux had the sweetest smile	23.0350
Ah monsieur said she you	562.7455
But what could these men	949.0700
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
Oh my God <PAD> <PAD>	6.6029
What has he done <PAD>	8.1352
Poor dear man he is	1566.5758
What has he done madame	17.2967
I believe that his only	311.0575
Do you know him <PAD>	7.1189
Oh if you know him	879.5160
I do not know that	591.9634
Bonacieux with some embarrassment the	1250.7585
Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux	1468.8651
But continued DArtagnan how did	528.3746
Then as I believed my	1620.5781
I knew very well that	900.4169
The men I have put	488.4921
I have sent for three	370.2399
You are right cried the	30.3550
Bonacieux let us fly <PAD>	10.4790
Let us save ourselves At	1222.1991
But whither shall we flywhither	2425.9089
And now what are we	188.3046
I am at quite a	161.6868
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
My intention was to inform	1520.2479
Bonacieux looked earnestly at the	18.9105
And if I give you	654.8430
Then I believe you <PAD>	7.2939
You appear to be a	890.3372
Dispose of me then as	1857.9957
Yes here it is Who	610.7805
Nobody knows you <PAD> <PAD>	6.5562
Besides we are in a	480.8715
Where does he live Rue	858.0440
As DArtagnan had foreseen Athos	26.9172
He took the key which	943.4250

You are at home said	11.9551

That is well said Mme	13.4260
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
Now in my turn let	787.6930
Bonacieux darting at her the	1811.0745
In two bounds he was	522.7255
All the events we have	121.9935
Everything fell out as Mme	15.9332
Bonacieux prophesied <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.8458
On hearing the password Germain	25.3237
In a few minutes Laporte	433.7245
Bonacieux was <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.5313
Laporte assured himself by having	605.2618
Hardly however had he taken	46.0355
Young man said he to	1169.5413
Have you any friend whose	1141.2249
In a court of justice	249.7802
He took to his heels	847.6302
As DArtagnan so constantly frequented	1324.7653
Five minutes after M de	976.3215
Pardon me monsieur said DArtagnan	576.2676
But what can I do	463.2722
He expressed to him the	748.3497
As ten oclock was striking	1110.7383
He consequently sprang up again	1237.7670
Chapter XI <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.8601
IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS	9674.0117
On what was DArtagnan thinking	1654.1494
He was thinking of Mme	13.9170
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
For an apprentice Musketeer the	208.7183
Pretty mysterious initiated in almost	2129.2278
Moreover DArtagnan had delivered her	803.6843
DArtagnan already fancied himself so	1840.4985
We have observed that young	183.4876
Let us add that in	1614.6057
Without a blush men made	252.5161
Such as were only beautiful	1737.3635
DArtagnan owned nothing <PAD> <PAD>	8.7954
Provincial diffidence that slight varnish	2817.2400
DArtagnan following the strange custom	1314.4408
In each there was an	186.4708
But we must say at	618.7539
The mercer had said that	755.2087
We say almost for the	932.6739
There are in affluence a	747.5287
A fine and white stocking	5686.8413
Then DArtagnan as the reader	780.9451
In the meanwhile how disheartening	2432.8420
At least when the woman	524.6924
Then DArtagnan disposed to become	498.0410
In the midst of his	386.6329
The pretty Mme <PAD> <PAD>	10.6992
Bonacieux was just the woman	958.4865
Then one could enjoy charming	957.5948
Besides on pressing occasions in	302.6116
And M Bonacieux whom DArtagnan	1322.6830
We are compelled to admit	737.9338
Love is the most selfish	28.8087
Let our readers reassure themselves	20.0512
If DArtagnan forgets his host	1260.4319
But for the moment let	877.4027
DArtagnan reflecting on his future	2152.4155
As he found himself in	501.2500
Now if Aramis had been	857.5900
This mystery required an explanation	126.0852
He likewise thought this was	228.0208
Bonacieux of whom his head	57.3749
We must never look for	43.3072
First love is accompanied by	1330.4832
Paris for two hours past	86.7699
Eleven oclock sounded from all	124.2881
It was delightful weather <PAD>	11.7860
DArtagnan was passing along a	2881.7559
From a distance resounded deadened	4385.4077
Arrived at the end of	47.7581
The house in which Aramis	430.5650
DArtagnan had just passed the	910.1653
This something was enveloped in	622.0999
Further this woman as if	711.7285
DArtagnan was perplexed <PAD> <PAD>	7.8574
Shall I go and offer	39.8099
By her step she must	64.0408
Oh yes <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4088
But a woman who wanders	593.4528
If I should disturb a	1272.3800
This was neither long nor	20.1635
There were but three htels	697.9066
Pardieu said DArtagnan to himself	1259.0671
But on my soul it	20.5450
Ah my dear Aramis this	727.8431
The young woman continued to	1113.8771
DArtagnan believed this cough to	30.2415
Nevertheless whether the cough had	1578.4786
This is all very fine	36.6235
Ah Monsieur Hypocrite I understand	2900.0054
Ah ah said the listener	95.8240
Ah this visit was expected	11.8827
We shall see the windows	94.6464
Very pretty But to the	116.2546
Still more the light which	263.6304
DArtagnan thought this could not	570.2050
He was right at the	292.5255
The young woman in the	531.3080
It may be judged whether	124.5878
Unfortunately the light had been	477.7046
Besides the eyes of the	646.5654
DArtagnan then saw that the	1001.8572
She made her interlocutor observe	102.4937
This immediately recalled to DArtagnans	367.2410
Bonacieux which had reminded him	186.1635
What the devil could that	641.1540
We say Aramis because the	775.6788
Curiosity prevailed over prudence and	1075.9327
Upon gaining this advantage DArtagnan	850.1265
DArtagnan however could only see	814.0774
At the same instant the	799.6476
Then some words were spoken	35.6561
At length the shutter closed	15.3309
The woman who was outside	1430.6025
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
The suspicion that it was	638.8698
Bonacieux who had sent for	961.9681
This must be then an	536.5484
Love <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8461
But was it on her	635.7730
This was a question the	1164.1997
There was a very simple	122.3052
Bonacieux was going that was	18.0693
This method was so simple	164.8560
But at the sight of	994.5927
Bonacieux uttered a little cry	22.9362
DArtagnan ran after her <PAD>	9.4437
It was not difficult for	148.7178
He came up with her	111.0935
The unfortunate woman was exhausted	1189.3639
These protestations were nothing for	25.2697
Bonacieux for such protestations may	441.2382
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
Bonacieux thought she recognized the	966.9290
Thank God thank God Yes	631.7203
No said DArtagnan no I	15.8281
It was chance that threw	482.2610
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
Without doubt Aramis is one	40.6593
Who is he Come come	731.9751
Besides you must have seen	483.3114
And now Now escort me	1192.0819
But what I know is	377.4812
Take my arm and let	121.3777
Bonacieux who willingly took it	1368.5461
Arriving there the young woman	314.1426
She seemed however by certain	835.1191
But the moment is come	566.9364
I have not a penny	1109.5525
Do you wish to destroy	912.9929
Come come madame cried DArtagnan	1147.5914
Confide in me <PAD> <PAD>	5.5630
Have you not read in	824.7039
Bonacieux therefore ask my own	1090.8181
Oh meddle in nothing which	24.1934
Do not seek to assist	69.8012
This I ask of you	205.5051
Rather place faith in what	23.1629
Have no more concern about	800.5530
This is the second or	425.1721
Indeed madame you believe me	1101.4640
I only speak that exact	671.2812
We have nothing to fear	838.7708
That is because love has	620.9145
Listen I am already upon	38.3028
About three months ago I	1206.7539
The initials are only mineC	19.4016
B Constance Bonacieux Or Camille	197.9553
Once again silence <PAD> <PAD>	7.4640
Ah since the dangers I	1131.5864
There there midnight sounds <PAD>	12.5856
That is the hour when	519.7274
Be content I will depart	851.5505
Bonacieux holding out her hand	756.2328
DArtagnan seized the hand held	77.6439
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
I wish I had never	1172.0389
Well resumed Mme <PAD> <PAD>	10.1897
Bonacieux in a voice almost	877.2576
Who knows when I shall	684.3204
Oh as to that I	25.5688
That depends upon the sentiments	1661.9109
You are too charming said	895.4126
But be of good cheer	850.1946
Do not forget this eveningdo	112.6101
In the proper time and	42.0291
Now then go go in	26.7627
I was expected at sharp	1620.7018
And who told you I	586.5176
A man The discussion is	87.3722
Bonacieux with a halfsmile which	136.0642
No no I go I	14.4344
I believe in you and	525.3866
Adieu madame adieu And as	996.1888
Bonacieux knocked as at the	105.1795
When he had gained the	43.7957
The door had been opened	196.1158
DArtagnan pursued his way <PAD>	9.6146
He had given his word	40.1174
Bonacieux and if his life	533.1035
Five minutes later he was	55.3209
Poor Athos said he he	64.1366
He will have fallen asleep	843.0295
A woman with Athos <PAD>	8.6461
After all continued DArtagnan there	38.9000
All this is very strange	1040.1292
How badly <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1611
What do you mean by	40.1121
What has happened All sorts	800.9531
Athos arrested <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.8950
What for He was found	1042.5260
Why did he not tell	719.5858
They will believe he is	442.1826
Noble heart murmured DArtagnan <PAD>	9.8173
I know him well there	10.6929
And what did the officers	2033.8810
Two remained with the men	218.8836
The last two mounted guard	931.2061
Let them wait for me	26.0042
Here it would be dangerous	42.1670
I will run to Monsieur	914.9174
But you will remain you	390.8626
Be easy monsieur said Planchet	54.1214
I am brave when I	25.5262
It is all in beginning	10.4063
Besides I am a Picard	1121.9337
It appears that the method	186.3425
I shall use it again	1249.1224
M de Trville was not	30.4732
His company was on guard	173.0666
It was necessary to reach	630.4708
DArtagnan resolved to try and	29.2549
His costume of Guardsman in	267.5779
He therefore went down the	1622.4360
He had at first an	1174.0660
As he gained the top	1339.1954
Of the two persons who	184.7678
The woman had the outline	25.6297
Bonacieux the man resembled Aramis	75.9063
Besides the woman wore that	1623.7092
The womans hood was pulled	244.2883
Both as this double precaution	145.6392
They took the bridge <PAD>	9.7822
That was DArtagnans road as	46.7664
DArtagnan followed them <PAD> <PAD>	6.9370
He had not gone twenty	319.2820
Bonacieux and that the man	11.4142
He felt at that instant	144.4130
He felt himself doubly betrayed	551.5104
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
Bonacieux had declared to him	498.6427
DArtagnan did not reflect that	1287.8654
He considered himself an outraged	87.1035
Blood and anger mounted to	149.7323
The young man and young	177.8794
DArtagnan determined upon his course	13.6698
He passed them then returned	1053.5819
DArtagnan stopped before them and	31.7791
What do you want monsieur	1467.0151
It is not Aramis cried	11.3970
No monsieur it is not	533.8776
Yes replied the stranger <PAD>	8.1034
Allow me then to pass	416.5658
You do not know her	20.0877
You are deceived monsieur I	108.0734
Bonacieux in a tone of	678.0554
I hoped to be able	1162.5682
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
The Musketeer advanced two steps	125.3085
DArtagnan made a spring backward	44.3609
At the same time and	91.8737
In the name of heaven	42.5840
Bonacieux throwing herself between the	149.2731
My Lord cried DArtagnan enlightened	96.8123
Pardon me monsieur but you	221.6788
Bonacieux in an undertone and	769.1494
But I love her my	32.6247
You know what it is	26.4892
Pardon me and then tell	932.2875
You offer me your services	97.1667
Follow us at a distance	1323.0508
Bonacieux to take twenty steps	1300.9962
As for DArtagnan he immediately	765.3240
Without giving them any explanation	980.2282
Meanwhile carried away as we	1138.6039

Bonacieux was known to belong	680.3756
Besides Germain was in the	189.4493
Bonacieux would be accused of	190.4198
She took the risk upon	17.3299
Her reputation would be lost	515.9704
Once within the interior of	448.7035
This space passed Mme <PAD>	14.7660
Bonacieux pushed a little servants	198.5666
The door yielded <PAD> <PAD>	8.1641
Both entered and found themselves	47.8667
Bonacieux was acquainted with all	635.0574
She closed the door after	1113.2968
The duke counted two stories	18.1269
She then turned to the	989.7594

One of the salient points	426.7336
Brave rash and enterprising this	459.7709
He had learned that the	745.7023

His Musketeers uniform became him	32.5802
At thirtyfive which was then	1127.7910
The favorite of two kings	2107.3938
Sure of himself convinced of	966.8501
It was thus he had	976.8672
George Villiers placed himself before	1147.5619
At this moment a door	115.5434
Buckingham saw this apparition in	56.7465
It was the queen <PAD>	6.7457
Anne of Austria was then	863.3827
Her carriage was that of	1193.1401
Her mouth was small and	1734.4962
Her skin was admired for	2369.9524
Lastly her hair which from	1623.1240

Never had Anne of Austria	1755.9053
Anne of Austria took two	24.8997

Duke you already know that	273.5571
Yes your Majesty cried the	16.0410

They who love believe easily	23.7856
Besides I have lost nothing	653.6323
I see you to tell	1419.3403
It is sacrilege to struggle	88.7039
In short I see you	748.2316
You talk of sacrilege <PAD>	11.2871
Why the sacrilege is the	1052.8531

Ah then madame I was	83.0843

Eight days after I was	25.9785

The king excited by the	59.7762
Madame de Vernet was driven	2233.1221
I am not allowed to	149.8997
What object think you have	1324.3157
The pleasure of seeing you	10.8030
I have no hope of	131.8976
But this war may bring	1066.0850
They will not dare to	348.6331
Thousands of men it is	425.2573
All this is perhaps follyperhaps	1556.6536
All these proofs of love	715.9186
If you loved me you	49.0913
If you loved me oh	788.8281
Ah Madame de Chevreuse was	44.1075

Thanks for those sweet words	13.6072
Oh my beautiful sovereign a	98.1420

Would God send the same	173.2742
Should we have the same	218.0760
You love me my beautiful	896.4661

Chapter XIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3714
MONSIEUR BONACIEUX There was in	2026.0260
This personage was M Bonacieux	5136.3789
Fortunately the reader may remember	462.1035
The officers who arrested him	1450.7081
Thence introduced into a halfsubterranean	699.5148
The officers perceived that they	604.9435

The accused replied that his	2888.3069

He complicated this exordium by	1464.5696
After this second part of	3320.6533
The reflections of the mercer	1488.5833
At bottom the character of	3867.7693

How is it possible for	2875.3650
Consider monsieur the thing is	1191.5953
What have you done with	1148.0452
Ah Bonacieux inferred from this	270.9048
They have abducted her added	751.0877
Come answer freely M Bonacieux	120.2226
Had he better deny everything	36.3690
By denying all it might	1565.9626
He decided then to tell	14.5305
I suspect said he a	479.0086

Oh as to his name	436.6638

Oh my God my God	710.0195
Bonacieux could not close his	996.8033
He sat all night on	1244.0254
All at once he heard	141.3957
He believed they were come	684.9390
Your affair has become more	1248.6509
Interrogate me I entreat you	500.0585

Come now what are you	904.2984
The two guards led in	16.5821

Not Monsieur dArtagnan exclaimed the	18.3833
Not the least in the	24.9173
What is this gentlemans name	31.6334
I can not tell you	36.7242
You dont know him No	589.4158
Athos replied the Musketeer <PAD>	10.0401
But that is not a	508.6798
That is my name said	18.7696
But you said that your	544.8809

Yours is a pretty business	957.7432
Your Monsieur Bonacieux is very	3436.2419
You understand Athos shrugged his	2790.2742
They locked the mercer in	595.4980
Bonacieux wept all day like	928.0867
In the evening about nine	478.8584
These steps drew near to	222.4823
Follow me said an officer	53.3360
Follow you cried Bonacieux follow	37.0364
Where my God Where we	763.4957
He passed along the same	1084.6460
They made him enter this	646.3105
The carriage was put in	129.7479
Through the closely fastened windows	1034.7909
At the moment of arriving	2145.3433
He thought the carriage was	28.1673
The carriage however passed on	12.6414
Farther on a still greater	2414.3516
One thing however reassured him	1702.7828
But when he saw the	801.8367
He wished to confess to	992.7646
This measure somewhat reassured Bonacieux	30.2291
If they meant to execute	1426.5740
Indeed the carriage crossed the	49.6179
There remained then no other	980.5751
This time there was no	1080.0187
Bonacieux had flattered himself in	1385.7402

THE MAN OF MEUNG The	1421.0305
The carriage which had been	1921.4207
The door opened two guards	351.2812
They carried him through an	458.6594
All these movements had been	169.3251
He had walked as one	647.2617
His ears had perceived sounds	1613.5936
He remained on the bench	1034.9883
On looking around him however	1973.4521
At this movement which nobody	1295.6788
At length with the help	661.8563
At this moment an officer	833.4482
Is your name Bonacieux said	16.1159
Yes Monsieur Officer stammered the	800.9459
And he moved out of	67.7718
The latter obeyed without reply	191.0370
It was a large cabinet	1420.6349
A square table covered with	2672.7966
Standing before the chimney was	1839.7378
Although this man was scarcely	1616.8669
This man except a sword	1437.9999
This man was Armand Jean	2638.4146
At first sight nothing denoted	789.0930
The poor mercer remained standing	1235.1444
Is this that Bonacieux asked	52.7603
Yes monseigneur replied the officer	12.7242
Thats well <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.1634
Give me those papers and	824.1284
Bonacieux recognized in these papers	66.7422
From time to time the	972.9094
At the end of ten	286.1771
That head has never conspired	1389.7000
So I have been told	1309.3925
You have conspired with your	1836.6901
Yes monseigneur but I told	1454.8174
You are stupid replied the	15.3809
Thats exactly what my wife	2421.6697
Did you know that No	15.0984
I learned it since I	712.7341
Then you are ignorant of	1582.1425
What can have become of	74.1035
Nothing is concealed from the	827.5903
He calls me his dear	57.8054
Peste Matters are going all	1899.9348

At these words he took	197.0220
Go said he in a	38.9804
Tell him to come to	435.0288
The officer sprang out of	858.7808
To your Eminence murmured Bonacieux	136.9868
Five seconds has scarcely elapsed	896.8240
It is he cried Bonacieux	12.5719
He <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8499

The man who abducted my	119.5431

Place this man in the	680.2150
This is quite another man	70.1962
Monsieur is I am sure	185.1492
The officer took Bonacieux by	585.7566
The newly introduced personage followed	1660.2333
Who asked his Eminence <PAD>	10.2985
He and she The queen	35.8924
Yes Where At the Louvre	1729.1351
Now let us try to	874.5599
Rochefort all is not lost	577.3215
They were one in the	36.6475

Does your Eminence command that	1718.2144
The cardinal being left alone	410.5194
The same officer appeared <PAD>	10.4900
Bring the prisoner in again	17.4851
M Bonacieux was introduced afresh	243.4384
You have deceived me said	27.0398
I cried Bonacieux I deceive	3658.6875
Your Eminence is right <PAD>	10.9158
I told my wife several	1839.0720
Ah monseigneur continued Bonacieux throwing	2063.9988
I have touched the hand	51.1702
The great man has called	639.0522
Here take this purse of	1183.3285
But you are able to	496.5565
Pardon you monseigneur <PAD> <PAD>	7.2215

I see it and I	20.4673
Thus then you will take	1638.6813
Monseigneur Au revoir Monsieur Bonacieux	2742.5728
He then went out backward	895.4224
Long life to his Eminence	12.4562
Long life to the great	923.1231
As he was in the	200.7360
Well said the cardinal eagerly	1048.3605
Well said the latter a	872.1993
The duchess is at Tours	50.2715
It is in London they	856.8718
Let the queen remain in	286.2884
Let her believe that we	99.9672
Send me the keeper of	1079.4142

I have made him a	1355.5876

Then he rang <PAD> <PAD>	7.0808
The officer entered for the	21.0312

As to Aramis he had	514.4009
M de Trville was the	28.9521
The lowest or the least	677.2744
He repaired then instantly to	57.3865
The officer who commanded the	1576.3568
Athos had passed through all	144.5681
We were present at the	248.1736
Athos who had till that	463.5197
He added that he did	68.2380
Bonacieux that he had never	326.6909
Twenty witnesses added he could	2011.0916
The second commissary was as	992.3737
Athos was then sent to	191.1847
It was precisely at this	799.6404
As captain of the Musketeers	274.7079
It is well known how	1834.0366
One of the grand causes	399.2283
de Chevreuse <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0218
These two women gave him	1006.1429
In his eyes and to	27.0638
de Chevreuse not only served	2002.7009
At the first word the	35.8048
de Chevreusewho though exiled to	1613.0175
Capricious and unfaithful the king	283.1846
Posterity will find a difficulty	1038.9291
But when the cardinal added	36.2498
de Chevreuse had been in	1120.1350
could not contain himself and	1041.8064
And yet in all this	252.5231
At this instant M de	257.5200
Informed of what had passed	548.4455
Louis XIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3746
had already placed his hand	836.2073
You arrive in good time	771.9760
I have the honor to	1046.6333
A propos monseigneur continued Trville	1813.8505
Athos then went to pay	543.3091
A written examination attests it	2400.3103
Come come Trville hold your	44.5007
If his Eminence entertains any	1572.6735
No monseigneur <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1912
Besides DArtagnan passed the evening	582.4675
No God forbid said the	437.5703
The house may be suspected	701.4316
And the next day Bernajoux	14.4341
Yes sire yes it is	965.6697
That concerns your Majesty more	49.2693
I should affirm the culpability	108.6747
But his Majesty has judges	341.7053
Send the case before the	1109.5953
The army I will answer	1358.6370
He was desirous of an	911.7013
Police affairs cried the king	124.4599
And what do you know	21.6995
Meddle with your Musketeers and	69.7095
It appears according to your	707.1785
What a noise about a	18.3996
I would arrest ten of	1205.9388
It is best to constitute	764.7579
Sire replied Trville without lowering	1372.8717
Well so much the better	765.9542
If his Eminence said he	705.1776
If we release the prisoner	1247.1584
He will not desert Monsieur	642.3214
Besides added he lowering his	1571.4801
made Richelieu smile <PAD> <PAD>	8.2856
Order it as you please	1114.7852
It is not mercy then	638.3521
Yes sire in solitary confinement	1756.1984
I believe with your Majesty	3057.8574
The king signed the order	231.3238
As he was about to	1099.6603
One has never the last	33.3446
But let us be quickthe	1116.4945
The first time he saw	901.2532
There still remains that of	1206.8949
Sire Buckingham has been in	282.2434
IN WHICH M SGUIER KEEPER	38489.1680
He grew pale and red	1033.7118
Buckingham in Paris cried he	953.7532
To conspire against my honor	1571.8375
The queen is too virtuous	2054.3635
Madame de Lannoy whom according	1882.5039
Cardinal I must have the	100.3565
It seems to me that	1127.4812
A Florentine adventurer sire and	2245.1924
The more she has forgotten	525.9930
Besides I long ago determined	657.5323
She has near her a	797.2324
You think then as I	70.6191
I believe and I repeat	531.1014
I tell you the queen	592.5483
Why did you not have	115.4652
Arrest the prime minister of	31.5712
Think of it sire <PAD>	7.9670
What a scandal <PAD> <PAD>	7.5343
And if the suspicions of	951.7788
stopped terrified at what he	1450.6508
He should have been Nothing	29.3923
But all the time he	584.1452
No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8453
Where is that By the	379.6447
Monsieur Duke I must have	1647.7885
Are you also in accord	1138.9965
The matter enters completely into	1671.5831
I requested him to call	565.5456
I will go to the	970.4311
The queen was in the	31.0080

In a corner was the	355.9133
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
Gumen was reading aloud and	569.2615
These thoughts gilded as they	343.9706
Anne of Austria deprived of	688.3713
Like those unfortunate persons endowed	699.7940
Her friendship was a fatal	78.5787
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
de Chevreuse and Mme <PAD>	12.5340
de Bernet were exiled and	1282.3289
It was at the moment	549.8962
The reader hushed herself instantly	26.4537
All the ladies rose and	40.8562
As to the king he	156.9899
Madame said he you are	612.1469
What can the chancellor have	669.5499
When the chancellor appeared the	107.7205
The chancellor entered half smiling	43.7300
As we shall probably meet	868.4445
This chancellor was a pleasant	18.7866
He was Des Roches le	4753.8726
The cardinal trusted him and	54.6304
There are many stories related	64.1426
After a wild youth he	1110.6409
On entering this holy place	1367.7985
He was incessantly attacked by	941.7288
At the denunciating sound the	2281.9404
This advice appeared good to	35.6129
He conjured the evil spirit	349.3448
But the devil does not	1033.4561
In proportion as they redoubled	1914.3240
The monks had no longer	48.3903
By day they did nothing	952.7596
It is not known whether	1153.9287
On leaving the convent he	1315.0477
The queen was still standing	1214.2339
Truly this is an indignity	1135.2053
Has not his Majesty just	779.3083
I am a criminal as	20.2117
Estafania give up the keys	1521.4735
When the chancellor had opened	1725.8501
The chancellor advanced therefore toward	1881.2908
His majesty is certain that	528.6170
This letter is not in	1149.9141
I am a faithful subject	621.9724
I have written a letter	78.3317
The letter is here And	153.3760
Then give me that letter	32.8474
I will give it to	63.3580
If the king had desired	374.4701
But I repeat to you	629.9315
What do you say That	946.7693
Be kind enough then madame	375.7606
Do you know that monsieur	278.5653
No no I would rather	1005.1277
The chancellor made a profound	26.4814
Then with the intention quite	776.7684
The queen was as we	34.1503
The commission might well be	931.3371
Without doubt the chancellor Sguier	1188.5022
Anne of Austria took one	1011.4834
There monsieur there is that	628.4841
The door was scarcely closed	637.9367
The chancellor carried the letter	216.0601
The king took it with	1051.5847
It was nothing but a	48.0113
The queen pressed her brother	752.3849
The king quite delighted inquired	806.6514
The king went straight to	15.0486
There Duke said he you	41.0417
The whole intrigue is political	600.5539
Well your Majesty said he	1110.5186
In your place in truth	824.5518
I say that according to	893.8087
You would be the happier	503.9276
Be satisfied all who are	1177.6786
God forbid that the queen	256.9381
She has always believed me	1567.6459
Oh if she betrayed your	722.0760
And even if she were	1056.9537
Allow me then sire to	1168.1913
You have committed the first	148.7666
I make the first advances	23.1964
Never Sire I entreat you	1525.9825
I will answer for it	899.7092
Clemency is a royal virtue	1773.1842
Anne of Austria who in	1011.9475
Her first movement was repellent	17.0674
Her womanly pride and her	2325.8738
The king took advantage of	1002.7275
A fte was so rare	1209.1362
She asked upon what day	859.2461
Indeed every day the king	839.5574
Ten days passed away thus	14.4221
On the eighth day after	1095.0504
Send me five hundred pistoles	914.5114
Richelieu counted on his fingers	1526.6442
It will require four or	950.0123
Now allowing for contrary winds	2999.1536
Today is the twentieth of	16.1773
The aldermen of the city	139.8332
That will fall in wonderfully	621.8712
BONACIEUX AT HOME It was	703.1130
Louis XIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3746
was struck with this insistence	335.2471
More than once the king	1224.2043
He hoped then in a	1017.3712
He went then to the	1072.2896
Anne of Austria lowered her	2185.7346
meant <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8476
Louis XIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3746
wanted a discussion from which	1060.8785
He arrived at this end	58.0598
But cried Anne of Austria	1024.4713
What have I done then	9.7154
Let me know what crime	25.3099
It is impossible that your	1570.8290
Madame said he with dignity	271.7389
I wish in order to	1660.1676
That is my answer The	26.1322
Anne of Austria believed that	29.5623
knew all and that the	1266.2699
She became excessively pale leaned	2054.2959
You hear madame said the	791.7826
You hear madame Yes sire	59.4393
You will appear at this	2703.2402
Then that is agreed said	249.2567
Louis XIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3746
felt instinctively that he ought	767.3938
Oh very shortly madame said	277.7338
I will ask the cardinal	694.8118
Is there any crime in	1137.9139
The king went away enchanted	15.9366
I am lost murmured the	737.3841
I am lost <PAD> <PAD>	7.0056
My God my God my	2640.3113
In fact her position was	17.9184
Buckingham had returned to London	20.3905
de Chevreuse was at Tours	14.7503
More closely watched than ever	1047.5784
Laporte could not leave the	400.5262
Thus while contemplating the misfortune	1453.3142
Can I be of service	423.1471
The queen turned sharply round	790.4080
In fact at one of	391.4632
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
She had been engaged in	1029.7932
The queen uttered a piercing	1602.9417
Oh fear nothing madame said	1222.0750
I am betrayed on all	18.7603
Can I trust in you	959.7497
Yes continued Mme <PAD> <PAD>	9.4673
Bonacieux yes there are traitors	823.1081
Those studs which the king	348.5453
Those studs were enclosed in	351.8614
Am I deceived <PAD> <PAD>	6.8651
Is it not so madame	671.8237
Well those studs continued Mme	23.3494
Bonacieux we must have them	579.2374
How can it be effected	193.2910
In whom can I trust	640.4485
Two words from the hand	1463.9558
But I will answer for	289.8624
I must then place my	676.0370
Tell me at least the	323.2280
I have not yet had	30.1806
He is a worthy honest	318.2953
He will do anything I	13.7336
He will set out upon	1538.0272
Do that cried she and	615.1804
I have nothing to save	1105.3069
She wrote two lines sealed	447.0284
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
And now said the queen	751.8262
Bonacieux blushed <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3832
Yes that is true said	649.0771
Is that what you would	294.6004
Nevertheless let not your Majesty	567.0930
Those who have read the	35.8030
de Motteville will not be	40.7945
But wait a minute Anne	135.0790
Here said she here is	139.2194
It came from my brother	36.7536
It is mine and I	54.5834
Take this ring raise money	1243.9916
Bonacieux could hardly hear what	1733.3824
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
Bonacieux kissed the hands of	633.9161
Ten minutes afterward she was	22.9805

Well be it so said	11.1848
Perhaps when all is considered	23.2961
In the long run a	1311.5083

Besides she found herself in	323.5940
The queen might be as	4489.1177
Listen said she I yield	122.7539
But I swear to you	745.9576
This was their mutual declaration	26.1547
DArtagnan was radiant with joy	23.6395

Confidence and love made him	19.1431

As to that cried DArtagnan	722.8091
Bonacieux hesitated to continue <PAD>	10.6006
You have perhaps no money	94.8160
Then replied Mme <PAD> <PAD>	9.0985
Bonacieux opening a cupboard and	1240.6694

He will see us if	598.2753
Bonacieux you speak that in	67.6957
Bonacieux pronounced these words with	39.9534
DArtagnan saw those tears and	208.9015
With me you will be	553.3076
Once there for greater security	68.9784
They both approached the window	1039.8237
At sight of this man	238.3716
It was the man of	12.5247
What are you going to	26.1647
Bonacieux you will ruin us	179.9509
Your life is devoted from	79.7541

Silence said DArtagnan taking her	138.7494
Never mind continued the man	437.2893
You would then be in	35.1825
The state which is now	1283.9967
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
Silence said DArtagnan pressing her	32.3318
How is there still time	38.8505
I go to the Louvre	37.0024
Bonacieux I say that I	514.9658
I will return soon to	230.2211
Infamous said Mme <PAD> <PAD>	8.3776
Bonacieux addressing this epithet to	27.0008
Silence said DArtagnan pressing her	48.0080
A terrible howling interrupted these	108.0683
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
It was her husband who	1580.7753
Bonacieux he will rouse the	1766.4177

A few seconds afterward DArtagnan	2292.5098
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
Bonacieux followed him with her	543.6735
PLAN OF CAMPAIGN DArtagnan went	112.7714
He had reflected that in	811.6545
The heart of the young	33.1816
An opportunity presented itself to	795.4560
This chance did then for	339.8253
M de Trville was in	133.9145
DArtagnan who was known as	624.6711
DArtagnan had been there scarcely	109.9287
At the first glance and	845.6138
All the way along DArtagnan	1365.9852
But M de Trville had	853.2621
Did you ask for me	69.4916
Yes monsieur said DArtagnan lowering	687.0246
I say monsieur that chance	1004.6615
I tell you so by	882.2100
Believe me continued Trville in	1237.8490
Besides you can tell them	461.2291
Sending their leave of absence	447.8656
You are a hundred times	680.8598
Ha <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8470
But first write your request	29.7544
Perhaps you had a spy	632.0762
Have the goodness to send	50.3983
I should dread some disagreeable	290.5661
Adieu and a prosperous voyage	14.1942
A propos said M de	58.5194
DArtagnan returned <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.2282
Have you any money DArtagnan	95.1463
Enough asked M de Trville	14.2653
Three hundred pistoles Oh plenty	18.8826
That would carry you to	27.5253
Begone then DArtagnan saluted M	1184.4745
Since his first arrival at	868.2122
His first visit was to	570.5836
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
Still further he had seldom	1003.1699
This evening especially Aramis was	34.9613
DArtagnan asked some questions about	42.8545
Aramis pleaded as his excuse	2156.4910
After the two friends had	1851.8882
What is that asked Aramis	9.6043
The leave of absence Monsieur	58.3405
For me <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.7186

Pack up all you want	635.7521
What is become of her	9.4934

Become of whom replied Aramis	10.3348
The woman who was herethe	1643.2533
I saw her And you	442.4553
Since you appear to know	561.0394
Yes that may be <PAD>	7.5387
You evidently know her <PAD>	9.4829
But why did she return	1536.1254
I fancied myself despised betrayed	20.3228
I was so delighted to	22.1336
I could not have believed	813.2208
Oh youll know it someday	2405.4377
Well then since she has	582.4825
You say we are going	802.5723

At all events it is	1075.9656
When well assured this search	1864.2576
Only as they went out	654.4865
To nobody in the world	1087.2474
They found him holding his	535.7042

MY DEAR ATHOS I wish	833.6593

Yours affectionate DE TRVILLE Well	1518.1550

Pardieu said he here is	20.2932
Since when I wonder in	1412.6525
To what country demanded Porthos	14.5529
My faith <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1216
I dont know much about	23.8505
Ask DArtagnan To London gentlemen	24.2956
To London cried Porthos and	567.3418
Nor I said Athos <PAD>	7.0593
I have replied DArtagnan pulling	281.3542
There are in this bag	32.1397
Let each take seventyfive that	145.6011
Besides make yourselves easy we	1489.2919
But if we do risk	673.4633
And yet said Aramis I	738.8275
No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8453
He says to you jauntily	1511.8160
Why <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8474
You need give yourselves no	1455.2365
So let us go and	95.9801
Is life worth the trouble	43.9681
DArtagnan I am ready to	55.3672
And I also said Aramis	10.1115
And indeed I am not	1362.1366

Immediately replied DArtagnan we have	89.2165
Planchet <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8373
Mousqueton <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8429
Bazin cried the four young	3415.1960
Planchet Grimaud Mousqueton and Bazin	70.5669
Now let us lay down	67.5343
Where do we go first	1075.0271
DArtagnan will give each of	25.9463

If we are attacked we	1803.2157
They would have an easy	754.0975
We will arm our four	1750.2786
I agree to Athoss plan	16.4518
And you Porthos I agree	128.6529
DArtagnan being the bearer of	772.6746

Chapter XX <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.8345
THE JOURNEY At two oclock	1261.6616
As long as it was	868.2643
With the first rays of	452.0259
It was like the eve	563.6452
Besides the appearance of the	26.8611
The black horses of the	1486.0430
The lackeys followed armed to	26.9676
All went well till they	413.5387
They needed breakfast and alighted	3463.2556
They ordered the lackeys not	939.9522
They entered the common hall	59.0935
A gentleman who had just	726.6259
He opened the conversation about	121.6896
He drank to their good	95.9745
But at the moment Mousqueton	721.2034
Porthos replied that he asked	384.2623
The stranger cried that he	98.1198
Porthos called him drunk and	48.8815
You have committed a piece	720.8303
Kill the fellow and rejoin	904.1674
There goes one cried Athos	81.9881
But why did that man	238.8034
Because as Porthos was talking	356.7838
I always said that this	1457.5247
At Beauvais they stopped two	600.2645
At the end of two	531.7595
At a league from Beauvais	1942.0463
Aramis not liking to soil	813.7891
Athos wished to restrain him	44.1073
The laborers began to jeer	2641.1702
Then each of these men	1208.1813
Aramis received a ball which	2045.1281
Therefore Mousqueton alone fell from	1014.2407
It was an ambuscade shouted	20.3361
Dont waste a charge <PAD>	11.2424
Forward Aramis wounded as he	363.7054
Mousquetons horse rejoined them and	82.3726
That will serve us for	38.4393
I would rather have had	27.0905
Mine was carried away by	20.0288
By my faith it is	884.1586
If Porthos were on his	176.1234
My opinion is that on	1041.4860
The travelers had chosen crossroads	2280.5654
In fact it required all	1598.1686
He grew more pale every	279.4993
They lifted him off at	886.9135
Morbleu said Athos as soon	512.3185
Morbleu I wont be their	62.2217
I will neither open my	237.8306
I swear by Dont waste	2635.8394
They arrived at Amiens at	376.7903
The host had the appearance	104.4638
He received the travelers with	348.7111
He wished to lodge the	1690.2432
DArtagnan and Athos refused them	11.7243
The host replied that he	935.3176
The host insisted but the	287.1893
They had just prepared their	2972.8357
It was indeed Planchet and	14.6237
Grimaud can take care of	29.2410
If you are willing gentlemen	1199.2371
Here is my bed replied	91.3861
Come then said DArtagnan you	15.0614
Mine hosts face does not	639.6452
Planchet mounted by the window	1345.5465
The night was quiet enough	14.2680
Toward two oclock in the	862.3997
At four oclock in the	138.3956
Grimaud had tried to waken	378.2767
When they opened the window	1196.5604
Planchet went down into the	447.7543
Mousquetons horse which had traveled	1119.1510
This began to be annoying	12.8158
All these successive accidents were	865.5163
Athos and DArtagnan went out	758.2469
At the door stood two	105.0611
These would just have suited	17.9166
He asked where their masters	493.6548
Athos went down to pay	233.5327
The host was in a	163.8142
Athos entered without the least	230.3359
The host was alone seated	350.9032
He took the money which	477.7536
You blackguard cried Athos going	2185.2490
I am taken shouted Athos	84.4832
Go on DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	6.0800
Spur spur and he fired	26.6502
DArtagnan and Planchet did not	1406.4440
Do you know what has	175.7376
Ah monsieur said Planchet I	525.6287
Forward Planchet forward <PAD> <PAD>	8.2126
You are a brave fellow	906.1000
Besides I am here in	961.1406
At St Omer they breathed	2090.0310
At a hundred paces from	1153.6200
There still remained Planchets horse	494.7084
Fortunately as we have said	748.0710
Planchet called his masters attention	935.4121
They made all speed to	251.0461
His boots were covered with	552.3542
Nothing would be more easy	818.4090
Look you may see it	1401.2548
And with his lackey he	93.8832
DArtagnan and Planchet followed the	100.1283
Once outside the city DArtagnan	218.0717
Monsieur you appear to be	608.7833
My own service said DArtagnan	11.7260
But this is a needless	840.2639
Hola Lubin my pistols Planchet	2099.5562
Go on with your affair	1285.9722
In three seconds DArtagnan had	1520.2711
DArtagnan believed him to be	731.7646
This time the gentleman closed	33.2789
DArtagnan searched his pockets and	132.0849
It was in the name	30.9934
Then casting a glance on	873.1232
But he was soon aroused	1947.8092
Planchet grasped him by the	100.7760
Monsieur said he as long	842.4186
I know him for a	2600.2659
Stay said DArtagnan and taking	55.8090
Now said Planchet let us	2430.8904
And now said DArtagnan to	158.7954
Oh thats nothing <PAD> <PAD>	8.0052
Let us attend to what	918.7309
The Comte de Wardes was	61.1622
You have an order signed	46.6457
Yes monsieur replied DArtagnan here	40.0073
It is quite regular and	40.5225
Most likely said DArtagnan I	1124.1250
Whom This DArtagnan Perfectly well	3487.4370
Is he accompanied Yes by	2087.8586
DArtagnan lost no time in	25.5003
He thanked the governor bowed	26.7202
Once outside he and Planchet	1523.2985
The vessel was quite ready	173.3313
Well said he on perceiving	13.0331
Here is my pass countersigned	27.4368
And that other gentleman <PAD>	8.8082
He will not go today	946.4150
Let us go repeated DArtagnan	12.4799
He leaped with Planchet into	197.2428
It was time for they	921.6980
It was the cannon which	51.5008
He had now leisure to	34.3239
Fortunately as DArtagnan had thought	26.1579
The point of the sword	176.1573
Still further his shirt had	600.5897
DArtagnan was worn out with	18.0367
A mattress was laid upon	42.4606
He threw himself upon it	29.8993
On the morrow at break	610.8102
The breeze had been so	170.8477
At ten oclock the vessel	1565.2892
In England the post was	22.5179
DArtagnan and Planchet took each	192.1636
In a few hours they	29.1053
DArtagnan did not know London	633.1688
The duke was at Windsor	43.0713
DArtagnan inquired for the confidential	1265.4279
The confidence with which DArtagnan	379.7900
He ordered two horses to	292.2275
As for Planchet he had	1190.5730

But that which astonished him	970.1248
It was then upon the	647.6516
While he was listening to	695.1406
The horses went like the	288.6046
DArtagnan imagined that on arriving	484.8693
He kept on his way	850.2887
In fact in crossing the	1634.3340
DArtagnan followed him amid cries	96.0282
On entering the court of	1417.1836
DArtagnan did the same with	1447.2128
The duke walked so fast	222.0307
He passed through several apartments	1330.3607
In the alcove of this	678.3888
With discretion DArtagnan remained behind	1427.7622
The two found themselves in	2999.3196
Over a species of altar	3253.3809
One might believe the queen	26.9334
On the altar and beneath	211.0586
The duke approached the altar	854.8793
There said he drawing from	1614.6218
The queen gave them to	54.4727
Her will be done like	646.0973
All at once he uttered	26.8221
What is the matter exclaimed	1303.4769
Hold see <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.0003
The ribbons which held them	2582.3345
The only time I have	1617.7145
The Comtesse de Winter with	371.9053
That reconciliation was nothing but	72.7344
I have never seen her	21.9311
The woman is an agent	375.5211
Oh yes said Buckingham grating	63.6111
Yes he is a terrible	15.8469
But when is this ball	146.4685
Still five days before us	13.2893
Thats more time than we	15.7060
Patrick cried the duke opening	340.4031
My jeweler and my secretary	2516.2942
But although the jeweler had	345.8163
This was simply because he	41.3209
He found Buckingham seated at	366.4379
Mr <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8481
Jackson said he go instantly	534.7801
I wish them to be	2079.7644
He will say in that	451.3916
We are safe on that	78.2637
If the studs are not	846.4626
Buckingham saw by the expression	293.0325
Yes said he yes Anne	55.0251
Upon a word from her	715.4746
She asked me not to	818.8364
I broke my word it	65.9934
I obeyed my love and	147.7799
It was to that obedience	1533.0249

You see there are two	1738.5735

Oh you may even see	123.9212
Your captivity shall be mild	2681.7839
As to the goldsmith he	749.2358
Buckingham conducted the goldsmith to	825.1917
Then he placed a sentinel	1386.7926
We need not add that	1532.6682
This point settled the duke	27.0097
Now my young friend said	47.9863
What do you wish for	9.3824
What do you desire A	49.9864
At present I confess that	1027.6310

DArtagnan approached him with the	71.9825

And perhaps you look for	807.6609
When I am happy I	445.5642

No you are at your	42.8358

DArtagnan then perceived a thing	1065.1693
Besides the wheels of a	629.5543
At length DArtagnan in pursuing	441.0068
This glove wherever it had	319.6299
It was one of those	365.5332
As DArtagnan pursued his investigations	2763.8682
And yet he said to	412.4031
Bonacieux that the young woman	475.2456
But all these reasons were	4268.4697
Then DArtagnan became almost wild	15.5283
He ran along the high	1371.2406
About seven oclock in the	1198.6122
There were then as now	199.6148
Cloud and who had reasons	497.3179
Bonacieux whom the boatman had	18.6478
DArtagnan took advantage of the	1069.4561
Bonacieux once again and satisfy	317.6641
Cloud and not elsewhere before	125.9836
Everything conspired to prove to	658.7299
He again ran back to	22.2452
It appeared to him that	832.4299
The lane was still deserted	318.4808
DArtagnan then thought of that	1028.0020
The gate of the enclosure	705.9366
No one answered to his	20.3146
A silence of death reigned	750.6978
It soon appeared to him	1728.1262
Then DArtagnan ceased knocking and	1940.2145
At length an old wormeaten	2451.3992
Nevertheless rapid as the movement	493.9584
In the name of heaven	422.6886
I am dying with anxiety	13.7802
Has anything particular happened in	25.8915
Speak The window was again	885.5603
DArtagnan related his story simply	66.9099
He told how he had	684.8596
The old man listened attentively	702.2311
What do you mean cried	13.7589
In the name of heaven	30.0586
Monsieur said the old man	565.1946
In that case in the	571.0724
As I am very poor	640.3997
In the shadow was a	70.5540
These horses evidently belonged to	124.9267
Ah my worthy gentlemen cried	538.7180
Yes monsieur the one with	869.8000
Only remember thisif you speak	697.9971
After shutting the gate behind	740.5776
The three men brought the	1423.8325
The little old man remained	1037.8289
All at once great cries	627.0676
Then I saw no more	93.6577
The woman screamed and cried	164.9895
Two of the men appeared	429.9103
The leader closed the window	670.5099
His two companions were already	25.3120
He sprang into his saddle	1156.1245
From that moment I have	1906.8544
But my good gentleman resumed	1893.4366
He is my demon apparently	13.8828
And the other Which The	775.4658
Poor woman poor woman what	673.7228
And I renew my promise	13.2669
Be easy I am a	14.3634
A gentleman has but his	972.1591
Sometimes he hoped it could	30.1221
Bonacieux and that he should	743.6080
His mind was torn by	47.6674
Oh if I had my	583.0952
DArtagnan went successively into all	740.7344
At the sixth he began	126.6988
DArtagnan had appointed six oclock	428.3591
Besides it came into the	680.6310
At the sixth cabaret then	922.4354
He was compelled then after	922.5682
Toward six oclock DArtagnan awoke	1776.4432
He was not long in	24.6791
He examined himself to see	814.7838
The first thing he perceived	1502.1274
Chapter XXV <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6664
PORTHOS Instead of returning directly	1812.7896
This time he had decided	47.7102
M de Trville would doubtless	172.3894
Besides as M de Trville	1704.0450
M de Trville listened to	1242.4094
When DArtagnan had finished he	21.8330
All this savors of his	326.6102
Nothing absolutely nothing at present	282.4449
I will see the queen	428.3793
These details will guide her	862.0342
Rely on me DArtagnan knew	748.4874
He bowed to him then	454.0338
Determined to put the advice	1884.5419
On approaching the house he	283.7084
All that the prudent Planchet	762.1658
In fact in addition to	1778.5656
A rogue does not laugh	1414.7294
All falsehood is a mask	1204.4681
It appeared then to DArtagnan	1299.1761
In consequence of this feeling	592.1754
Well young man said he	106.6624
Seven oclock in the morning	9.6531
Peste You seem to reverse	1556.4591
It is true that when	1124.6221
Happiness comes to meet him	2282.8752
Ah ah said Bonacieux you	59.5082
But where the devil were	97.9782
It does not appear to	1764.6801
Both were stained with splashes	91.2129
Then a sudden idea crossed	34.5295
That little stout man short	2405.5615
The husband had presided at	55.8695
A terrible inclination seized DArtagnan	1041.4036
However the revolution which appeared	956.0212
Ah but you are joking	39.1655
It appears to me that	1581.7275
May you not have been	80.9000
Oh the devil <PAD> <PAD>	6.1839
Thats unpardonable in a man	835.8665
no said Bonacieux but yesterday	1256.4319
Bonacieux had named Mand because	417.9729
Cloud <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8431
This probability afforded him his	32.1553
If Bonacieux knew where his	1723.1323
The question then was how	94.9099
Pardon my dear Monsieur Bonacieux	1792.2262
I am parched with thirst	18.3906
Allow me to take a	1205.6064
It had not been used	10.6712
Bonacieux had not been abed	12.6359
He had only been back	612.3710
Thanks Monsieur Bonacieux said DArtagnan	177.0583
I will now go up	26.6261
I will make Planchet brush	677.0706
At the top of the	92.2240
Ah monsieur cried Planchet as	204.2816
I thought you would never	172.3224
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
I give you a hundred	674.5190
Come speak Monsieur de Cavois	3285.2202
What did you answer him	524.2170
Oh I saw the snare	205.3334
Where has he gone asked	34.4101
To Troyes in Champagne I	25.0308
And when did he set	1429.4080
The falsehood would then lie	741.4401
In a quarter of an	652.2607
Besides are you not as	553.7756
Indeed I think provincial air	417.9625
So then So then pack	245.0188
On my part I will	339.2973
You may join me at	55.7858
By the way Planchet I	644.4921
I am a physiognomist I	246.0944
Then in order that he	595.4149
No news had been received	1094.8953
DArtagnan took charge of it	10.8635
Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined	274.6880
DArtagnan in order that there	168.3544
Thats well said he to	132.9310
Now saddle the other three	1749.2532
No Monsieur Jester replied DArtagnan	1418.6941
As they went from the	2460.5771
DArtagnan and Planchet entered Pierrefitte	24.2413
Planchet was more courageous it	119.1095
His natural prudence however never	121.8014
He had forgotten not one	520.9248
It followed that his hat	1361.5021
Nevertheless whether the passengers were	1435.0873
The host on seeing a	891.7108
Now as they had already	1059.7379
Perhaps it would not be	192.9458
The result of these reflections	1550.8295
DArtagnan was therefore served with	33.2372
The regiment of the Guards	978.4238
The host desired himself to	1666.8378
My faith my good host	1027.5829
Take your glass then and	26.9405
But what shall we drink	154.6299
Let us drink to the	1312.6051
In htels that do not	1055.1233
Now I travel a great	1185.1135
Why I was here only	52.5701
I was conducting some friends	1138.9149
It is not Monsieur Porthos	185.6809
My God my dear host	1267.4648
We have made considerable advances	1123.0872
You can not tell me	9.9796
Surely you ought to be	838.4540
Take the stairs on your	320.8173
Only warn him that it	1060.8477
Ah I can understand that	9.5460
It is a demand that	610.8094
As our house is carried	1273.6432
It is true he had	134.1734
And with whom Lord who	28.2520
With some gentleman who was	924.9609
When we observed this to	1044.4510
We also informed Monsieur Porthos	996.6911
Then continued the host I	489.0939
This reply was too flattering	125.1697
I confined myself then to	787.4954
Nevertheless while acknowledging the truth	1077.5372
Since that time monsieur nobody	99.2622
Mousqueton is here then Oh	21.8586
Five days after your departure	194.5014
It appears that he had	107.1240
Unfortunately he is more nimble	754.4014
The favorite of a great	1375.7905
By the word of a	599.3069
This was before his servant	14.0822
As he could not leave	1093.5100
This was fulfilling the intentions	655.8611
I repeat to you I	720.8176
It struck me as very	2222.2913
What have I said You	746.8428
Because he had boasted that	994.2721
As Monsieur Porthos is a	1299.1792
Your friends soul must stick	1656.8279
The affair was not long	22.1689
They placed themselves on guard	1059.3206
He immediately fell backward <PAD>	13.7869
The stranger placed the point	677.4587
Upon which the stranger asked	522.4841
Porthoss chamber is you say	1272.7495
Be satisfied said DArtagnan laughing	1815.1769
Yesterday he wrote again but	519.1132
Besides Porthos can not owe	46.1137
Twenty good pistoles already without	38.4096
He denies himself nothing it	1719.0052
So my dear host be	770.2680
At the top of the	1118.6644
Porthos was in bed and	935.0812
In addition to this he	744.4688
At the sight of his	1013.2120
Ah pardieu Is that you	31.4295
You are right welcome <PAD>	10.3793
Excuse my not coming to	605.0765
And what has happened to	45.7504
Why on making a thrust	1333.8499
Luckily for the rascal for	560.5503
But you my dear DArtagnan	632.9143
I shall be about again	341.5834
You must be cruelly bored	1036.7190
He accepted my challenge and	1767.2400
But you my dear DArtagnan	692.7099
You know the proverb Unlucky	1532.8553
What consequence can the reverses	39.6591
Have you not happy rogue	909.5944
I wrote to her to	847.6270
But you are here my	54.9937
I confess I began to	1189.1279
So so replied Porthos <PAD>	8.3794
Only three or four days	1508.6510
So you see being in	956.2670
Not I unfortunately said Porthos	11.4063
This miserable strain confines me	511.1577
Friend Mousqueton you see that	762.0470
I may be besieged in	531.5840
There is nothing more easy	70.9948
One only needs to be	36.3327
I was brought up in	653.4282
Now he was accustomed to	1621.9619
He lowered his gun in	893.1351
It goes without saying that	2597.8704
For my part monsieur I	2192.7341
Oh of the most unfortunate	20.6845
One day he was surprised	955.9159
Then they came and boasted	1018.8796
We let them tell their	43.6337
Then as in leaving the	955.0822
Two hours after all was	1042.8387
And you say in his	792.2282
The consequence is that when	2108.7690
While walking near the wood	1953.1691
So that now thanks be	2520.6294
Your host That is to	835.9546
It has so chanced that	1313.2906
This lackey was my compatriot	1410.9310
We loved sporting of all	953.2004
My friend placed a bottle	759.4718
I practiced this exercise and	1714.7891
Well do you understand monsieur	11.1269
Our host has a wellfurnished	1732.9965
Now through this ventilating hole	995.4054
You see monsieur what the	1085.4966
Now will you taste our	850.5863
While Porthos and Mousqueton were	2673.1089
But there the confidence of	16.8920
He only added that on	1635.2109
At this moment Planchet entered	831.1361
As DArtagnan was tolerably reassured	787.7952
For the rest as he	1230.0405
Porthos replied that in all	437.3615
Besides it was necessary he	281.0369
DArtagnan wished that answer might	1069.5148

ARAMIS AND HIS THESIS DArtagnan	766.5135
Our Barnais was a prudent	90.2428
Consequently he had appeared to	1198.6893
Besides we feel always a	1258.3757
In his projects of intrigue	630.6104
And yet as he journeyed	212.8701
He thought of that young	29.1301
Bonacieux who was to have	746.7823
For himself he had no	603.7836
How he had found grace	672.5439
Nothing makes time pass more	2204.9795
External existence then resembles a	99.9718
By its influence time has	231.2452
We depart from one place	71.3744
Of the interval passed nothing	1976.0256
It was as a prey	1584.6091
There only his memory returned	17.8289
He shook his head perceived	762.3898
This time it was not	71.4387
DArtagnan was a physiognomist <PAD>	9.4276
His eye took in at	709.6772
My good dame asked DArtagnan	797.6978
Well monsieur he is still	1790.7312
Let me embrace him I	821.5471
Has he a lady with	20.0813
What do you mean by	12.0099
Poor lad <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1073
No monsieur he has not	701.3434
But there was no getting	645.5184
Bazin was stationed in the	1334.9703
In fact the dream of	960.5482
The dailyrenewed promise of the	606.8562
Bazin was then at the	20.3051
In all probability this time	54.6930
The union of physical pain	450.9660
Aramis suffering at once in	872.0530
It may be easily understood	1036.6449
He resolved then to defend	783.8337
But DArtagnan took very little	1026.3386
The door opened and DArtagnan	29.5854
Aramis in a black gown	2135.2375
At his right hand was	427.8365
The curtains were half drawn	652.6982
All the mundane objects that	1034.7904
In their stead DArtagnan thought	2413.3848
At the noise made by	655.7861
Good day dear DArtagnan said	583.3766
But what makes you doubt	378.3298
Then another error seized me	1911.0461
I disturb you perhaps my	523.1654
You disturb me <PAD> <PAD>	7.3547
Oh quite the contrary dear	610.9442
Praise God monsieur replied they	28.8381
I have not failed to	283.3475
You arrive in good time	1031.8173
Monsieur the Principal of Amiens	2121.8491
On the contrary replied Aramis	67.7993
The question is this Monsieur	1929.0935
Are you then making a	103.7398
In the examination which precedes	2005.2963
Now continued Aramis taking the	1262.9443
This is the reason why	958.0515
Which means resumed Aramis that	1601.0426
Admirable and dogmatic repeated the	1679.8765
As to DArtagnan he remained	176.2852
Yes admirable <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3795
prorsus admirabile continued Aramis but	575.3407
Now I have confessed to	882.0952
I should find myself therefore	1585.9901
See what an exordium cried	28.4853
Exordium repeated the curate for	46.2343
Quemadmodum inter clorum immensitatem Aramis	2065.9158
Let us speak French my	1237.6731

Peter blessed with the fingers	12.9246
The Pope therefore blesses with	33.4248
And with how many fingers	36.9866
With three fingers to be	1612.8882
DArtagnan thought it was proper	36.8056
The Pope is the successor	7306.9810
The most humble clerks such	7711.6768
There is the subject simplified	13.2860
Argumentum omni denudatum ornamento <PAD>	23.4291
I could make of that	905.7683
DArtagnan trembled <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0825
Certes said Aramis I do	604.1799
I had chosen this texttell	2813.4568
There is a proposition almost	2097.5439
Take care my young friend	11.8845
You are inclining toward false	1750.2970
You approach that famous point	134.4944
You face the insinuations of	1729.0214
How will you prove continued	991.5961
Listen to this dilemma God	79.1277
To regret the world is	714.5152
But for heavens sake resumed	21.3919
Desideras diabolum unhappy man cried	34.2330
He regrets the devil <PAD>	10.6071
Ah my young friend added	1108.7042
It seemed to him as	492.5178
He was however forced to	381.8757
But listen to me then	173.9117
I do not say I	1487.4629
No but pray grant me	884.7714
Dont you think so DArtagnan	41.7564
The Jesuit and the curate	76.0003
This is the point of	38.0045
The world is not wanting	26.4485
I quit the world then	34.1853
Now the Scripture says positively	1093.6410
And then said Aramis pinching	916.5868
A rondeau said the curate	23.0960
Repeat it <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.6364
Repeat it cried DArtagnan it	910.0291
Here it is said Aramis	1001.6661
The Jesuit persisted in his	23.4199
Beware of a profane taste	55.4196
What says Augustine on this	2678.1216
Now hastily interrupted the Jesuit	2622.0325
There it is cried the	782.7506

It however became necessary for	746.0630
You have often heard me	495.0614
Oh DArtagnan The devil <PAD>	9.6068
Why people jest with death	1214.2501
You must have had enough	18.8515
As for me I have	122.9676
Then I confess to you	1072.3040
Now on such a day	214.0187
If you can be satisfied	2900.9792
I mean spinach replied Aramis	1462.3777
What will our two friends	14.9251
What will Monsieur de Trville	18.3379
They will treat you as	568.2892
I deserted the Church for	607.9756
I know nothing about it	970.1993
Besides the Scriptures say Confess	1324.7091
You see I am a	1057.1594
I was about to become	45.0436
One evening I went according	785.8472
An officer who saw me	858.7369
That evening I had translated	1528.0505
Her pose which I must	130.8861
He said nothing but when	153.3866
Monsieur the Abb said he	560.4094
If you venture again into	502.3842
I became very pale I	1719.6464
The officer waited for his	1322.8899
I returned to the seminary	11.8566
I am a gentleman born	377.3187
The insult was terrible and	711.3635
I informed my superiors that	1413.5082
I sought out the best	1268.1473
Then on the anniversary of	984.7984
It was in the Rue	95.1469
As I expected my officer	17.7654
I went up to him	959.1398
Monsieur said I does it	737.0743
And would you still cane	193.5737
The officer looked at me	226.0798
I do not know you	1244.5665
I recollect now said the	569.5680
Ladies said the officer do	696.1211
I took him to the	842.2174
It was a superb moonlight	21.3465
We immediately drew and at	419.5120

The king entertained great regard	1412.4645
You may understand that the	915.4062

And who am I to	33.1233
A poor Musketeer a beggar	4719.7979
Dust I am and to	19.7504
Life is full of humiliations	1694.8984
Oh my dear DArtagnan resumed	421.3289
Conceal your wounds when you	132.8481
Beware of giving anyone the	2443.2805
I do not know where	97.9236
She is perhaps a prisoner	618.7209
You are my friend today	596.7914
As for the world it	99.6929
All this is very sad	55.9334
My vocation commands me it	244.5034
Aramis continued And yet while	917.6031
To love you cry Fie	15.5598
Friends are shadows <PAD> <PAD>	7.6468
The world is a sepulcher	312.5051
Well then let us say	1009.5661
A letter which was sent	466.9457
I must have lost it	176.2207
But fortunately the world is	984.3688
Fie DArtagnan DArtagnan cried Aramis	499.3893
Aramis made a bound seized	369.0625
This same waiting maid seems	249.9178
Thanks DArtagnan thanks cried Aramis	72.4398
She was forced to return	231.9754
Come my friend come let	26.2779
Happiness almost stifles me The	5138.0054
At that moment Bazin entered	68.4462
Be off you wretch cried	111.4761
Return whence you came take	208.1850
Order a larded hare a	7283.3818
Now this is the moment	768.6353
Non inutile desiderium oblatione Go	155.4946
Let us drink my dear	331.8899
Let us drink heartily and	587.4429
THE WIFE OF ATHOS We	1619.2665
Do you think then that	108.8117
Athos is so cool so	253.2389
Nobody has a higher opinion	591.5616
I fear lest Athos should	142.1109
Those fellows strike hard and	100.6183
This is why I wish	623.2294
Yesterday I undertook to employ	2070.5737
Sleep as soundly as you	1510.0437
What are you looking at	16.1715
My faith <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1216
I am admiring three magnificent	240.8439
It would be a pleasure	1049.3392
Which Whichever of the three	1533.3057
That is enough to drive	775.5367
On my soul handsome stirrups	18.3019
Hol Bazin come here this	277.7838
That last order is useless	592.1266
Come Monsieur Bazin make yourself	1542.7024
Of what use is it	44.6320
You do not avoid going	660.7051
And Monsieur de Nogaret de	150.5679
He is a cardinal likewise	12.1138
Ask his lackey how often	418.2751
I know it monsieur everything	1470.7449
Hold my stirrup Bazin cried	1448.6599
DArtagnan who foreseeing such an	1130.9187
Thats all right my dear	635.1937
No I have good luck	21.7965
But how do you mean	91.5573
No more theses no more	691.9315
I will make verses said	15.4871
Yes I dare say verses	969.4344
Teach Bazin prosody that will	31.2819
As to the horse ride	801.2901
You will find me ready	1122.8549
How was he going to	15.0200
Should he find him at	11.7936
The position in which he	38.6854
He probably had succumbed <PAD>	12.3447
This idea while darkening his	2714.0481
Of all his friends Athos	648.0708
Yet he entertained a marked	51.2271
The noble and distinguished air	1410.0439
Indeed when placed beside M	3551.7195
He was of middle height	1218.2059
His head with piercing eyes	2621.2075
His hands of which he	1578.2822
The sound of his voice	632.9194
If a repast were on	2224.5632
If a question in heraldry	2523.3306
Etiquette had no minuti unknown	22.7256
He knew what were the	74.2310
He was profoundly versed in	2855.9724
himself who took a pride	123.4489
Like all the great nobles	235.1990
But still further his education	2302.7009
Two or three times even	975.0309
Besides his probity was irreproachable	2779.7390
This Athos then was a	22.4411
And yet this nature so	3349.4946
Athos in his hours of	1207.4463
Then the demigod vanished he	42.2741
His head hanging down his	2218.3613
If the four friends were	1242.3081
In exchange for his silence	1678.9395
DArtagnan whose inquiring disposition we	3015.8579
Athos never received any letters	272.5003
It could not be said	856.1223
This excess of bilious humor	2631.1152
He had been known in	986.2336
Neither was it as with	1943.7240
June and July were the	34.8909
For the present he had	16.9862
He shrugged his shoulders when	56.7438
His secret then was in	136.4539
This mysterious shade spread over	1855.6786
Well thought DArtagnan poor Athos	863.6561
Do you remember how he	68.1190
And when he had discharged	290.2057
One might have said that	2260.5500
About eleven oclock in the	766.5297
DArtagnan had often meditated against	3872.7373
He entered the hostelry with	847.9128
Do you remember me said	92.3388
I have not that honor	883.9276
What you dont know me	237.6038
What have you done with	1036.1586
Ah monseigneur do not mention	300.0338
Ah monseigneur how dearly have	1544.9631
Sit down in mercy DArtagnan	1040.9537
Planchet glared fiercely over the	53.1848
Here is the story monseigneur	146.5323
It was you who rode	522.8105
Monseigneur I was furnished with	1354.0940
I took then in conformity	1220.6569
Pardon me monseigneur for saying	110.8397
The authorities had terrified me	1263.1997
What has become of him	9.9667
Is he dead <PAD> <PAD>	6.3478
Is he living Patience monseigneur	60.1803
There happened then that which	816.8896
That gentleman your friend defended	36.3011
His lackey who by an	5981.1846
And I really dont know	1267.9127
Monsieur your friend pardon for	832.2327
As we were sure of	615.4788
To imprison him monseigneur <PAD>	13.3954
Why he imprisoned himself I	34.3259
In the first place he	550.4534
The dead man and the	633.3185
As for myself as soon	787.5788
Monsieur the Governor was all	17.3304
He told me he knew	426.2675
It appears that I had	480.7995
Ah monsieur he was no	47.9909
To my offer of liberty	453.2309
I told him very humblyfor	1523.1263
In the first place said	1128.6711
Monsieur Grimaud he told us	1387.5103
Where is Athos In the	60.2837
Have you kept him in	97.8428
No monsieur <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4876
We keep him in the	14.6707
You do not know what	38.4965
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
If you could but persuade	647.9521
I shall find him there	289.9078
We every day pass through	1211.1853
It is not of bread	144.6207
I once endeavored to go	413.2153
I heard the noise he	432.6422
Then when we asked them	783.7187
Upon this I went and	391.6357
So from that time monsieur	1119.3164
There is our wine in	1377.0507
And as we are prevented	1059.1549
If your friend remains another	1288.4434
Could you not perceive by	1007.2249
But hark hark <PAD> <PAD>	11.0665
There he is Somebody has	69.0131
But he must be disturbed	1380.6287
My wife has perhaps requested	1041.5928
Ah good heaven <PAD> <PAD>	7.8315
There is the hullabaloo louder	962.0906
He rose and preceded by	1262.0359
The two gentlemen were exasperated	570.7047
But this is tyranny cried	1116.1639
Nonsense let us break open	886.8199
One might have thought there	3077.0508
There was a moment of	897.9849
Planchet said DArtagnan cocking his	462.3676
Ah gentlemen you want battle	804.9105
They still hesitated an instant	2406.4094
Stand on one side DArtagnan	63.3801
I am going to fire	803.3533
Patience Athos <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.0357
You are running your heads	228.6785
My lackey and I will	366.3694
You will then have our	541.7892
Let me conduct your business	25.3364
You shall soon have something	1268.0210
The host felt a cold	87.5502
How <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8495
If there is any left	18.3958
What the devil <PAD> <PAD>	6.1871
There must be plenty left	23.0538
Be satisfied of that these	97.9858
Gentlemen return your swords to	2214.8438
Then turning toward Planchet he	155.3048
The Englishmen convinced of these	268.3287
The history of Athoss imprisonment	1035.2449
Now gentlemen said DArtagnan go	466.3810
Now I am alone my	349.5760
Then was heard a great	1200.1964
An instant after the broken	821.7187
DArtagnan threw himself on his	60.2277
He then tried to draw	650.3576
You are wounded said he	9.8733
I <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8462
Not at all <PAD> <PAD>	5.9265
I am dead drunk thats	526.8239
By the Lord my good	15.1480
I must at least have	1373.8120
He would never think of	598.6686
Hark <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8456
I dont think he put	39.1589
Do you hear it <PAD>	7.6839
It is running now DArtagnan	1064.5438
In the meantime Grimaud appeared	950.2623
Like one of those drunken	106.9980
He was moistened before and	1280.4164
The four crossed the public	862.4380
In the meantime the host	1365.9884
Beyond the fortifications through which	1116.4423
The image of devastation and	3264.9248
Then the lamentations of the	153.4844
DArtagnan himself was moved by	14.5414
Athos did not even turn	19.1912
To grief succeeded rage <PAD>	14.1176
The host armed himself with	372.8065
Some wine said Athos on	26.8803
Some wine cried the stupefied	36.5521
Why you have drunk more	57.8383
I am a ruined man	2091.2732
That was your fault All	2314.1475
Triple ass said Athos rising	104.8554
He had tried his strength	24.6108
DArtagnan came to his relief	56.3690
The host drew back and	38.1213
This will teach you said	809.0004
Say the devil My dear	703.2670
I confess it but pardon	34.0702
You are gentlemen and I	29.3437
You will have pity on	474.0101
We are not such devils	43.0817
Come hither and let us	97.5689
Come hither I say and	51.1422
At the very moment when	476.2004
If it were bad money	1754.1647
Athoss horse where is that	2246.9373
Take it and there ends	434.3264
And pray upon what shall	390.8362
Another And a magnificent one	23.9921
Well since there is another	1167.4117
Some of that at the	31.3629
There are twentyfive bottles of	196.7121
Bring six of them Why	133.0583
If he only remains here	1712.1711
As he finished the host	798.0455
Thats well said Athos filling	215.1072
But you DArtagnan what is	115.8511
You have a sad air	1159.6089
Presently <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8502
And why presently <PAD> <PAD>	9.0373
Because you think I am	14.7761
DArtagnan remember this <PAD> <PAD>	6.9215
My ideas are never so	142.5650
Speak then I am all	119.2708
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
Athos listened to him without	1636.5970
You always say trifles my	1082.7231
Thats true said he quietly	1029.7648
Pierced hearts said Athos <PAD>	9.3547
What do you say I	463.3097
You are very fortunate to	69.8579
And if I have any	1014.3214
I never had one <PAD>	7.9240
Let us drink But then	229.4198
I stand in need of	2951.7932
The two things agree marvelously	112.7663
Athos collected himself and in	206.2223
He was at that period	627.8275
He kept himself upright and	47.8076
This somnambulism of drunkenness had	52.2111
You particularly wish it asked	15.4666
I pray for it said	12.9231
Be it then as you	12.2199
One of my friendsone of	1004.3688
Through the ingenuousness of her	483.1752
She did not please she	19.2319
She lived in a small	106.0062
Both had recently come into	22.1560
They came nobody knew whence	3017.5581
They were said however to	31.6772
My friend who was seigneur	1134.7913
Who would have come to	107.9711
Unfortunately he was an honorable	30.5676
The fool <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0667
The ass <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	7.2965
The idiot How so if	58.4743
Wait said Athos <PAD> <PAD>	6.0350
He took her to his	549.9507
Well one day when she	985.9148
The count flew to her	1065.9264
DArtagnan said Athos with a	1089.4504
A fleurdelis said Athos <PAD>	10.5291
She was branded Athos emptied	306.9736
Horror cried DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	6.4808
What do you tell me	29.7257
The angel was a demon	1238.5138
He had on his estates	107.1585
He tore the dress of	1036.8965
No less said Athos as	32.2221
But methinks I need wine	709.1164
Then he let his head	317.3330
That has cured me of	2619.3533
God grant you as much	11.7227
Let us drink Then she	47.1239
Parbleu said Athos <PAD> <PAD>	6.0296
But hold out your glass	13.6434
Some ham my boy or	334.7634
Her brother replied Athos <PAD>	9.7737
Yes the priest Oh I	737.1404
A worthy man who had	1072.4783
He has been hanged and	1668.2133
Taste some of this ham	1066.9369
What a pity it is	98.7037
I could have drunk fifty	1083.0026
Allowing his head to sink	104.8499
These young fellows can none	727.4247
THE RETURN DArtagnan was astounded	1432.5795
In the first place it	625.8366
All this doubt only gave	942.4821
Besides which the Musketeer after	882.5058
I was pretty drunk yesterday	1001.0731
I wager that I uttered	1949.4742
No replied DArtagnan if I	586.5772
I thought I had told	576.1220
My faith said DArtagnan it	681.8176
My drunkenness is always sad	2415.7334
That is my failinga capital	1655.5540
It is that then replied	373.6480
We were speaking of hanging	1461.8296
I remember now yes it	1936.5920
Well you see how a	922.4252
I certainly never will get	1397.7133
Yes but it is not	1143.6670
This morning I awoke at	24.0612
You were still fast asleep	678.1533
As I came into the	868.2908
I drew near and found	292.5592
Pardieu said I my good	411.7109
I saw him yesterday your	918.8531
Will you sell him to	1061.7693
Ah ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.2075
But please to observe I	81.5864
DArtagnan looked much disconcerted <PAD>	12.5556
This vexes you said Athos	12.0759
Well I must confess it	24.6870
That horse was to have	61.6319
It was a pledge a	16.4247
Athos you have done wrong	352.1795
I was hipped to death	328.1403
If it is only to	528.0278
As to the horse we	126.6691
Why the devil <PAD> <PAD>	6.1840
A horse is mortal suppose	492.1328
It vexes me greatly continued	1310.0552
I threw and I lost	1696.9557
I lost him then with	1447.4460
I should make an excellent	1099.8448
Well I was not hotheaded	131.0707
You had nothing left Oh	1008.8394
And as I am a	659.1066
I mentioned your diamond then	140.5275
What the devil my dear	1242.9266
Impossible Go on go on	741.4041
No I do not jest	174.4762
I had been fifteen days	898.4929
Hear the end <PAD> <PAD>	5.9139
Ten parts of a hundred	5155.4102
The number thirteen was always	1726.9078
Patience said Athos I had	14.6080
The Englishman was an original	705.0015
I staked Grimaud the silent	1721.0114
Grimaud himself understand and with	699.2553
Tell me now if persistence	94.8071
But this is droll cried	162.8317
You may guess finding the	1623.8873
I won back your harness	723.3904
In brief I regained your	53.1877
Thats where we are <PAD>	8.1959
That was a superb throw	1442.0602
Then the diamond is safe	26.0933
Intact my dear friend besides	1295.7517
You have not played for	529.7583
You have not played for	453.8866
I remarked that he regretted	60.4110
You appear to think much	23.2689
In your place I would	1319.5031
On my honor in one	2300.8953
Thats another matter <PAD> <PAD>	7.6047
Never never The devil said	15.8273
I would propose to you	722.3164
The Englishman is overflowing with	22.5765
Good Lord try one throw	16.5541
One throw is soon made	1327.6364
Athos went in quest of	1077.9607
The opportunity was good <PAD>	9.3135
He proposed the conditionsthe two	325.7294
The Englishman calculated fast the	207.7226
He consented <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3228
DArtagnan threw the dice with	1597.4897
He threw them on the	944.1942
Hold hold hold said Athos	420.8066
I have not seen such	60.6423
Two aces The Englishman looked	64.2012
DArtagnan looked and was seized	18.4900
Yes continued Athos four times	820.7252
Certainly said DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	5.8657
Then there is no revenge	1554.2764
Well Tempter what more do	57.5858
You want me to throw	729.6751
I would take the hundred	15.7411
You know you have staked	1115.3796
What is the use of	30.3417
I could not ride behind	13.8864
We should look like the	171.2411
You can not think of	518.2396
For my part I should	152.8633
We want money for our	747.9775
A horse slips and injures	3310.3708
There is a horse while	1684.5369
Anybody may see by our	2483.6697
Porthos cried Athos and laughed	18.4135
What is it asked DArtagnan	151.4431
Nothing nothing <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.1776
Go on Your advice then	83.8003
With the hundred pistoles we	96.7813
We have undergone a great	737.0389
Oh no Athos <PAD> <PAD>	6.4789
Once in Paris I shall	1028.0049
Take the hundred pistoles my	475.3245
This last reason appeared convincing	18.1158
Besides he feared that by	251.6177
He acquiesced therefore and chose	359.7812
They then determined to depart	13.5685
Peace with the landlord in	195.5617
DArtagnan and Athos took the	1014.3776
However ill our two friends	1252.2356
From a distance they perceived	1326.6870
Hol Aramis <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.1498
What the devil are you	43.3512
Ah is that you DArtagnan	30.8554
I was reflecting upon the	182.4305
My English horse which has	1572.8610
Life itself may be resolved	3826.7424
Which means that I have	830.0272
My dear DArtagnan said Aramis	98.5393
Necessity has no law besides	2234.0657
Ah you fellows are good	21.4960
You ride on our lackeys	4088.3354
The cart was returning empty	2590.7473
What is this said Aramis	31.7622
Nothing but saddles Now do	39.7834
My friends thats exactly like	20.4455
I retained my harness by	26.2414
Hol Bazin <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.7681
Bring my new saddle and	1080.8357
My dear fellow I invited	121.8435
They have some capital wine	93.4267
I did my best to	29.1925
Then the curate forbade me	2058.3767
I demand the suppression of	504.1891
I have begun a poem	72.4695
That is rather difficult but	156.6393

Aramis discharged his bill placed	965.1292

Porthos alone made no reply	13.0676
Yes horse <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.3853
Are we not eating a	20.5876
And perhaps his saddle therewith	218.6010
My faith said Aramis we	33.5256
One would think we had	159.9915
This horse made my visitors	1625.2631
Still replied Porthos <PAD> <PAD>	6.6314
And my faith the governor	674.0853
My God yes gave that	638.7698
Yes without the saddle You	856.9102
There is one comfort we	56.2139
Well for my part said	1144.3630

I have ordered Masses for	420.0921
Well then it appears that	60.6018
How much have you left	162.0123
Why in the first place	282.5813
I recollect Then I paid	187.6156
Why did you give him	704.7780
In brief how much remains	72.0881
And I said Athos taking	101.2033
Nothing My faith <PAD> <PAD>	8.8307
So little that it is	2107.1978
Four hundred and seventyfive livres	134.8605
On our arrival in Paris	313.7155
But our troop horses said	17.8368
Well of the four horses	797.3232
With the four hundred livres	513.6589
There Let us dine then	1281.4034
On arriving in Paris DArtagnan	869.5350
As this was the height	1112.1862
Bonacieuxhe ran full of joy	986.1301
They were assembled in council	706.0592
M de Trville had intimated	1337.8456
The four philosophers looked at	108.1414
M de Trville never jested	117.7025
And what do you reckon	81.5106
Oh we can scarcely say	12.0542
We have made our calculations	7366.9033
It seems to me said	1115.9867
Stop said he I have	567.9088
A thousand livres <PAD> <PAD>	8.8102
For my part I declare	1621.6881
What the devil <PAD> <PAD>	6.1871
DArtagnan is too good a	1029.3627
HUNTING FOR THE EQUIPMENTS The	2725.3503
To this preoccupation of his	467.3313
Notwithstanding all his inquiries respecting	27.0007
Bonacieux he could obtain no	26.5708
M de Trville had spoken	36.8403
The queen was ignorant where	906.1882
Athos did not leave his	667.4918
We have still fifteen days	486.1458
It will then be said	373.5233
It may be seen by	331.8182
The lackeys on their part	532.6974
Mousqueton collected a store of	2676.6968
The three friendsfor as we	1993.3888
They wandered about the streets	1011.7960
They might have been supposed	466.0148
When they met they looked	1371.0948
He was a man of	29.0625
DArtagnan perceived him one day	461.5679
He entered after having twisted	2986.7915
As DArtagnan took some precautions	193.5660
DArtagnan entered behind him <PAD>	9.2594
Porthos went and leaned against	46.7821
DArtagnan still unperceived supported himself	53.2681
There happened to be a	137.5838
Porthos took advantage of this	58.6228
Thanks to the cares of	318.5145
His hat was a little	2559.2361
DArtagnan observed on the bench	2240.2102
The eyes of Porthos were	1017.8453
On her side the lady	938.1669
It was plain that this	2099.6423
Porthos seeing this retwisted his	2136.5229
The lady with the black	1652.0416
During this time Porthos played	18.9414
It was almost imperceptible motions	2690.9287
Then she cried Ahem under	3726.4641
Porthos paid no attention <PAD>	10.6502
Nevertheless he understood it all	25.0649
The lady with the red	2285.0708
DArtagnan without losing sight of	1148.4728
He guessed that the lady	1237.9104
He guessed likewise by induction	2048.2129
Amid all this DArtagnan remarked	238.2960
There were only chimeras and	3670.1394
The sermon over the procurators	171.0170
Porthos went before her and	140.5932
The procurators wife smiled thinking	1136.1525
When she was only about	1112.8381
When the lady of the	812.8578
The fair worshipper touched the	1213.1095
This was too much for	950.7500
If she had been a	1102.1969
Mamadame cried he is that	9.7906
How is your husband our	37.1354
Is he still as stingy	23.1797
Where can my eyes have	447.8701
Ah said he you have	357.4863
I have something to say	1017.7094
At that moment DArtagnan passed	1440.2878
Eh eh said he reasoning	1703.0710
In the daytime nobody was	801.7285
Ah Monsieur Porthos cried the	873.3101
But that must be a	915.4084
Madame you are deceived said	842.2488
Coquenard had seen everything <PAD>	9.1464
Porthos regretted that he had	283.8333
Ah you are quite the	488.3416
Well responded Porthos you may	958.6022
Less quickly than the women	581.0762

Besides said she the sum	880.7250
I had but to write	1121.0017
Monsieur Porthos said she I	428.2514
Let us not talk about	1193.4270
Porthos maintained a majestic silence	17.2673
And that is the only	17.8800
Alas I understand Think of	125.8417
It remains here said Porthos	229.9267
I will repair it indeed	797.9420
A loan nothing more <PAD>	11.4444
After all I am not	24.6428
I know you are not	1554.7063
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
If you were a duchess	954.3692
Please to know Monsieur Porthos	907.8157
I am not precisely rich	1576.2109
You have misunderstood me all	328.6488
I advise you to complain	21.1763
Begone then to your beautiful	636.7706
Do you love me still	833.2333
Something whispers me so continued	86.6044
Rather say that you have	136.8384
No object affects me and	733.1208
But in fifteen days as	419.0595
I shall be fearfully preoccupied	48.1697
Then I must make a	944.7643
And as continued he the	685.5637
Journeys you know appear much	1389.2931
I thought I had said	1017.8593
Come to our house tomorrow	11.4689
You are the son of	1834.1415
Can you recollect all that	1958.4187
Peste Thats a fine age	26.2713
A great age you mean	23.0748
Yes the poor man may	1157.1333
Fortunately by our marriage contract	1768.8444
We are then reconciled dear	66.9930
For life replied Porthos in	23.2087
Till we meet again then	5762.7612
DARTAGNAN AND THE ENGLISHMAN DArtagnan	257.3322
He saw her get into	478.1583
It was useless to try	593.2952
DArtagnan therefore returned to the	23.5341
In the Rue de Seine	1258.8462
He ordered him to go	1583.9586
Once for all Trville had	90.4184
Planchet proceeded toward the Rue	194.8370
Athos was at home emptying	1049.4658
He made a sign for	267.0779
DArtagnan related to Athos all	926.9398
As for me replied Athos	534.0823
At that moment Planchet put	777.1038
What horses asked Athos <PAD>	9.3050
Two horses that Monsieur de	696.4130
Then DArtagnan described the meeting	427.5381
That is to say you	593.1600
I <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8462
not at all said DArtagnan	9.0688
I am only curious to	126.9912
I do not know why	858.6509
I do not know a	509.8916
Madame Bonacieux is lost so	799.7399
All my researches have been	18.6883
What is to be said	7.7432
I must divert my attention	1418.7625
Instead of shutting yourself up	1063.1868
So au revoir dear Athos	2610.5488
DArtagnan and Planchet mounted and	63.1644
All along the road what	63.5678
Bonacieux recurred to the mind	23.7858
Although DArtagnan was not of	1439.6156
As he said he was	290.9546
Meantime he was going to	42.2028
Milady had spoken to the	98.9925
Now in the opinion of	514.2057
Bonacieux the second time as	50.1310
DArtagnan then only halflied which	787.1088
Thinking of all this and	518.9083
He had just passed by	205.8029
was born <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0006
He rode up a very	748.2619
This person walked along the	99.6948
Planchet recognized him first <PAD>	9.1247
Eh monsieur said he addressing	953.8287
Why it is poor Lubin	1151.4734
Do you think he would	722.6950
At the end of an	1377.8776
He could not be mistaken	31.0298
DArtagnan leaned upon the neck	268.3764
Milady put her charming blond	413.3445
The lattera pretty girl of	3383.0745
DArtagnan followed the soubrette with	716.4093
The maid approached Planchet whom	2077.1519
Yes and important <PAD> <PAD>	6.6597
Take it quickly Thereupon she	1189.0645
Planchet turned and returned the	16.9242
Then accustomed to passive obedience	1492.1729
For you monsieur said Planchet	74.1282
For me said DArtagnan are	201.6905
The soubrette said For your	2106.9055

Well Planchet how is the	41.6431
He is not dead then	562.7965
As I said monsieur Lubin	720.3527
you are the king of	13.2957
Now jump onto your horse	431.9584
At the end of five	1484.5549
The conversation between Milady and	814.9019
The conversation took place in	1300.7183
She terminated it by an	725.4675
The cavalier laughed aloud which	146.7936
DArtagnan thought this was the	20.6003
He approached the other door	719.9626
It appears to me that	71.7479
Speak one word madame and	812.2534
You must be aware that	948.6877
Why does not he go	1073.5707
I do not go on	1066.2706
I speak to you in	368.0860
You are Madames brother I	2149.4697
The carriage went on and	595.5900
The cavalier made a movement	1233.4265
Well monsieur said he you	668.5631
It seems you must always	934.3418
We will see my dear	1189.0106
Do you wish to play	706.8262
Marvelous <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8477
That falls out oddly <PAD>	14.3389
Three is just my number	89.0620
I am Monsieur dArtagnan a	124.2511
And you I am Lord	1213.7059
As he was accustomed to	563.3254
He found Athos reclining upon	877.8961
He related to Athos all	172.5561
Athos was delighted to find	66.6464
We might say that was	17.5475
They immediately sent their lackeys	646.2859
Porthos drew his sword from	941.6331
Aramis who was constantly at	1553.0229
Athos by signs desired Grimaud	93.5401
DArtagnan employed himself in arranging	1122.5165

ENGLISH AND FRENCH The hour	2614.7959
Athos threw a piece of	71.1971
The lackeys were ordered to	38.9941
A silent party soon drew	313.9612
Then according to foreign custom	60.2910
The Englishmen were all men	1567.6533
But after all said Lord	588.2584
We can not fight with	2303.7639
Which only gives us a	208.5633
You played very willingly with	1726.6337
One plays with anybody but	1450.3595
Porthos and Aramis did the	11.4239
Does that satisfy you said	29.1872
Do you find me of	564.7757
Well <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8489
now shall I tell you	41.0086
What replied the Englishman <PAD>	8.2258
Why that is that you	719.6908
Gentlemen said Athos addressing at	893.0397
On guard then cried Athos	12.5045
Immediately eight swords glittered in	2094.4956
Athos fenced with as much	818.1577
Porthos abated no doubt of	1071.6588
Aramis who had the third	423.5479
Athos killed his adversary first	14.0479
He hit him but once	1140.6024
Second Porthos stretched his upon	2142.0803
Aramis pushed his so vigorously	1744.8655
As to DArtagnan he fought	1352.0229
The baron finding himself disarmed	1733.9091
DArtagnan was over him at	543.7386
The Englishman delighted at having	771.4472
As Porthos and Aramis were	1246.5776
DArtagnan picked it up and	63.0017
What the devil would you	49.3630
You can restore it to	28.8957
His family will care much	67.6143
His family will inherit fifteen	101.7070
Keep the purse for your	116.1893

At this time Athos came	21.5486
What do you mean to	46.6679
Why I meant to pass	91.1959
why to me Why you	16.1880
They are the spoils of	682.6585

This introduction to Milady Clarik	168.9061
He remembered in what a	469.4614
According to his conviction she	956.4493
His only fear was that	293.2075
Then she knew that he	526.8979
As to the commencement of	2149.2771
It is not for nothing	642.4271
DArtagnan began by making his	1213.9398
Athos listened to his projects	777.8589
What said he you have	1124.2532
I loved Madame Bonacieux with	399.1369
In getting introduced to her	2396.3843
She is some emissary of	621.9193
my dear Athos you view	722.7188
Can it be otherwise <PAD>	9.1975
I bought my experience dearlyparticularly	47.8334
Milady is fair you say	857.7143
Listen to me <PAD> <PAD>	5.3488
I want to be enlightened	615.5856
Lord de Winter arrived at	742.7264
He therefore found DArtagnan alone	334.7213
An elegant carriage waited below	1498.2495
Milady Clarik received DArtagnan ceremoniously	23.8235
Her htel was remarkably sumptuous	1517.2092
You see said Lord de	828.0178
Thank him then madame if	1954.3308
The brother did not perceive	1861.8386
You are welcome monsieur said	2006.4775
Milady listened with the greatest	1011.2312
The blood rose to her	429.2915
Lord de Winter perceived nothing	19.6767
When he had finished he	502.7822
He filled two glasses and	99.5662
DArtagnan knew it was considered	207.2876
He therefore drew near to	66.6602
He did not however lose	974.7543
Now that she believed herself	782.5047
She bit her handkerchief with	39.8410
That pretty little soubrette whom	122.5397
She spoke some words to	3495.1548
DArtagnan exchanged a shake of	228.6137
Her countenance with surprising mobility	4301.6812
Those lips were magnificent they	73.9961
The conversation took a cheerful	20.6370
Milady appeared to have entirely	17.1656
She told DArtagnan that Lord	139.7369
She had married a younger	383.9941
This child was the only	400.2713
All this showed DArtagnan that	960.7043
In addition to this after	1546.8665
DArtagnan was profuse in gallant	104.4529
To all the simple things	302.9546
The hour came for him	19.0126
DArtagnan took leave of Milady	122.2746
On the staircase he met	1210.7441
DArtagnan came again on the	194.8803
Lord de Winter was not	511.5768
She appeared to take a	571.4642
DArtagnan who as we have	1357.6389
He launched into a eulogy	1034.9784
Milady changed the conversation without	1080.7538
DArtagnan replied that he had	805.8467

On the morrow he received	1217.5984
His heart beat but not	120.2593
No a more material interest	44.0069
He was about at last	935.3640
He was about to see	791.3862
And then hea wanderer on	2388.0994
To come in the capacity	942.6992
The Musketeer could not forget	1676.2853
And yet at the very	139.0648
The approach was not such	4462.6909
Porthos knocked with his hand	11.4552
A tall pale clerk his	1610.1173
A shorter clerk came behind	2749.0867
In all three clerks and	370.0212
Although the Musketeer was not	1835.1774
Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8389
Coquenard therefore entered the office	596.1592
The clerks surveyed him with	1600.9717
It is my cousin cried	34.6854
Come in come in Monsieur	996.2649
They reached the office of	767.7726
This last apartment was a	120.9699
On quitting the study they	235.1502
All these rooms which communicated	190.6875
Words might be heard at	92.9630
Then while passing he had	1083.9769
The procurator had without doubt	965.8304
We are cousins it appears	1805.8212
The old man wrapped in	1402.8707

Unfortunately the legs began to	118.9970
During the last five or	1410.2726
The cousin was received with	36.6875
M Coquenard firm upon his	334.7870
Yes monsieur we are cousins	2086.5825
By the female side I	69.9387
Porthos did not feel the	579.3479

M Coquenard had since the	1580.0638
Porthos comprehended that this chest	1145.1803
M Coquenard did not carry	3287.3513
It appeared likewise that Mme	18.9502
Coquenard was not less affected	1051.1195
where are you murmured Coquenard	46.2769
This succor which came to	1186.2170
The hour of dinner soon	17.9140
They passed into the eating	279.9439
The clerks who as it	2282.5334
Their jaws moved preliminarily with	60.8089
Indeed thought Porthos casting a	1802.0502
They look like shipwrecked sailors	3455.9739

He had scarcely entered when	967.5220
Oh oh said he here	1269.7284

Afterward Mme <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.9910
Coquenard filled her own plate	438.6133
At this moment the door	1285.8851
After the soup the maid	2346.7026
One may see that you	876.0607
You are certainly treating your	3850.8315

Coquenard drew the dish toward	3236.9661

Will you eat any of	124.7790
Coquenard in that tone which	1540.0697
Porthos could hardly keep his	20.3207
The procurator repeated several times	73.0917
Accept my compliments your dinner	65.2145
Lord how I have eaten	1424.8824
Porthos fancied they were mystifying	2278.1873
Coquenard gently advised him to	27.9317
This silence and this interruption	845.1022
Upon a look from the	105.4767

This is fine said Porthos	1451.9607
Coquenard <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8437
Now said he the sacrifice	19.8740
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
if I had not the	1711.3867

The procurators wife took Porthos	1125.0012
You can come and dine	91.3972
Coquenard <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8437
Thanks madame said Porthos but	1438.6206
The Musketeers are as you	1676.2900
The procurators wife waited tremblingly	25.9256
To how much said she	10.7657
I hope it does not	134.8751
Oh no said Porthos it	169.1565
I even think that with	2043.5566
Why that is a fortune	135.7175
Coquenard understood it <PAD> <PAD>	6.7358
I wished to know the	1487.4778

I can just suit you	1496.0579
Then put down three hundred	164.1889
Porthos smiled <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5891
It may be remembered that	103.0430
These three hundred livres he	212.2203
Then continued he there is	87.1870

But then you understand Madame	1239.5076
There remains the valise added	20.6160
Oh dont let that disturb	37.8815
Coquenard <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8437
My husband has five or	129.5303

That which I have to	621.9445

Come in here Monsieur Chevalier	753.9993
But you need not fear	11.2410
She will not hear what	873.8429
The little apartment was charming	997.2939
Kitty guessed what was passing	260.7618
You love my mistress then	98.0210
Oh more than I can	22.6498
I am mad for her	75.9073
Alas monsieur said she that	421.1023
Because monsieur replied Kitty my	1212.4843
For me said DArtagnan seizing	17.2936
No for another For another	109.3971
Read the address Monsieur El	2320.0032
As quick as thought he	980.2357
Oh good Lord Monsieur Chevalier	633.9258
Are you indisposed or have	444.2008

You have an opportunity now	714.2481
Poor dear Monsieur dArtagnan said	924.6694
You pity me little one	18.2398
Oh yes and with all	348.9100
Alas yes Well then instead	1133.4258
And why not demanded DArtagnan	12.8789
For two reasons What ones	1021.2576
In what can I have	1056.8474
Speak I beg you I	605.4211
The young girl had freshness	604.5306
Kitty said he I will	622.3290

It is my mistress you	928.3257
He whose game is the	149.4077
But this time our Gascon	844.8053
The perfidious deceiver was as	3099.1501
Well said he to the	474.9139
Of that which I am	649.0846
Nevertheless to DArtagnans great astonishment	172.6651
Time passes quickly when it	105.0585
Midnight sounded and almost at	243.1051
Good God cried Kitty there	67.2842
Go go directly DArtagnan rose	994.9219
What are you doing cried	18.0436
DArtagnan who had secured the	170.8230
Well cried Milady in a	25.0868
Are you asleep that you	584.0862
Here am I Milady here	334.6997
Both went into the bedroom	1239.1453
She was at length appeased	578.7043
Well said Milady I have	139.2046

Can he be inconstant before	1977.6404
I understand my game Kitty	755.7667
Be easy Kitty there is	723.8531
Oh I will be revenged	128.3468
I detest him <PAD> <PAD>	7.9412
An idiot who held the	641.7104

Has he not already forgotten	33.6521
Fine vengeance that on my	266.6763
Why this woman was a	15.5574
He resumed his listening but	62.9049
That will do said Milady	821.4198
To be sure for Monsieur	1483.0330
On her side but as	1034.7262
Oh good Lord said Kitty	142.9811
How pale you are The	52.5319
Silence silence begone said Kitty	19.5051
There is nothing but a	994.7255
What said Kitty blushing <PAD>	12.7984
Or at least I will	79.9045
She had the less motive	144.9445
Therefore Kitty surrendered <PAD> <PAD>	10.9086
It was a movement of	32.1267
DArtagnan believed it right to	117.6927
With a little more heart	1156.4080
It must however be confessed	911.6874
Bonacieux but the poor girl	1006.9492
As to the cause which	1205.1041
As he had seen Milady	669.0258
But what was clearest in	1108.1868
DArtagnan came the next day	1003.6077
Kitty came in but Milady	46.2363
The poor girl ventured a	1315.4221
DArtagnan departed scarcely knowing what	946.8483
He found Kitty at the	279.2919
Kitty had been accused of	65.1668
Milady could not at all	1035.2736
DArtagnan made Kitty promise to	115.4698
The poor girl promised all	96.8114
Things passed as on the	16.1776
DArtagnan concealed himself in his	577.6851
As the night before DArtagnan	165.4889
At eleven oclock Kitty came	26.4990
She held in her hand	74.6858
This time the poor girl	320.3076
She belonged body and soul	49.1419
DArtagnan opened the letter and	500.0298
Beware that I do not	189.4471
If you repent of the	570.8633
DArtagnan colored and grew pale	140.2673
Oh you love her still	900.9611
No Kitty you are mistaken	13.8022
I do not love her	1051.4900
You told me that What	43.3142
You know it is you	776.5452
But now I am forced	735.4559
She has no occasion to	483.4250
I will come and ask	68.6035
To delay it a single	367.9930
From him whom you have	1707.1250
It was even according to	1917.5774
Besides DArtagnan from her own	2773.6843
And yet notwithstanding this want	2794.9321
DArtagnans plan was very simple	13.3183
By Kittys chamber he could	65.3442
He would take advantage of	339.0283
He might fail but something	53.9846
In eight days the campaign	736.3560
There said the young man	182.5719
It is the counts reply	785.3654
Listen my dear girl said	515.7517
Milady may discover that you	547.8903
Milady will then turn you	696.9741
But I am grateful I	1092.1744
DArtagnan replied in such a	134.7921
Although she cried freely before	1504.1458
Finally he promised that he	873.2968
This promise completed poor Kittys	37.8200

Duty likewise on its part	2035.8090
This day of reunion was	248.0299
Soon as Kitty left him	178.5379
He found Athos and Aramis	19.7747
Aramis had some slight inclination	54.6966
Athos according to his system	109.8689
Athos believed that everyone should	78.3430
He never gave advice but	338.6422
People in general he said	486.8566
The four friends were reunited	15.8014
The four countenances expressed four	1155.8655
At the end of a	1593.0945
He came to request his	799.2489
Is it my equipment Yes	34.8522
Well but cant you speak	283.8531
An instant after Bazin made	45.3500
What do you want with	702.1565
A man wishes to see	49.6190

What man A mendicant Give	5562.2944
If Monsieur Aramis hesitates to	697.4827
A thousand pardons gentlemen but	1630.6760
There remained Athos and DArtagnan	10.2799
I believe these fellows have	43.4205
What do you think DArtagnan	15.2575
I know that Porthos was	313.2034
But you my dear Athosyou	2997.0464
What do you think of	728.1371
the fair woman on whose	1133.4830
I have acquired certain knowledge	1242.9421
It is the longest road	822.8593
Athos was a gentleman punctilious	998.7496
He was therefore silent and	824.5569
We will therefore leave the	388.1876
Upon being informed that the	930.4533
On entering he found a	370.9369
You have asked for me	22.0855
I wish to speak with	17.9444
Is that your name monsieur	29.2762
You have brought me something	1054.1095
Look That is right replied	2203.7632
At the hint from the	528.1708
Bazin gone the mendicant cast	1353.8223
Aramis uttered a cry of	1180.2798
Perform your duty in camp	61.9761
Accept that which the bearer	1016.5657
Adieu or rather au revoir	3070.8591
Aramis then reperused the letter	76.1016
You may behave politely to	297.1483
Golden dreams cried Aramis <PAD>	10.9254
Oh beautiful life <PAD> <PAD>	7.8512
Yes we are young yes	63.5265
My love my blood my	16.5469
all all all are thine	2050.3862
Bazin scratched at the door	806.4695
Bazin was stupefied at the	552.3281
Now as DArtagnan used no	577.9449
The devil <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.6507
my dear Aramis said DArtagnan	664.2244
Well your publisher is very	2509.1138

Oh monsieur you can write	851.2960

A poet is as good	27.4784
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468

You are very fortunate my	1171.8556

It is long since we	808.4593
And having put three or	853.6329
The two friends repaired to	817.2722
As he was perfectly acquainted	1455.9409
They went to find Porthos	974.7195
DArtagnan uttered a cry of	104.6130
Ah my yellow horse cried	16.1891
Aramis look at that horse	68.7929
Ah my dear replied DArtagnan	773.9508
It is of an original	705.3132
It must have been for	428.2143
But how did this horse	1124.3121
She had forced us to	2104.9905
The husband heard of the	1122.3746

Meanwhile Mousqueton continued on his	1752.2944
Arrived there he fastened according	972.3149
In a short time the	1010.3544

Coquenard recognized her present and	989.8552
The anger which fired the	2106.6836

Porthos went away after having	1004.0150

A GASCON A MATCH FOR	2764.3308
As was his custom DArtagnan	148.2961
He found her in a	22.6331
Never had he been so	16.8152
Our Gascon knew by the	1057.5597
Kitty entered to bring some	20.2608
Her mistress put on a	207.9894
the poor girl was so	254.3570
DArtagnan looked at the two	880.9754
To the great lady she	954.9532
At ten oclock Milady began	51.7618
DArtagnan knew what she wanted	13.3543
She looked at the clock	1363.0911
The young man felt her	947.8946
She loves him devilishly he	22.2363
Then he went out <PAD>	8.0015
This time Kitty was nowhere	1358.7108
It was necessary that DArtagnan	106.1974
She heard him enter but	63.4771
The young man went to	143.4949
As DArtagnan had presumed on	1270.2432
Returning to her own room	1881.0468
The poor girl under the	80.7201
DArtagnan himself was frightened by	42.8234
She joined her hands with	276.9841
As little sensitive as was	1200.3337
He did not therefore allow	1118.6559
For the rest this vengeance	2367.8762
Before daybreak M de Wardes	154.9167
Presently they heard Milady retire	32.8051
DArtagnan slipped into the wardrobe	14.9748
Hardly was he concealed when	37.9432
Kitty went to her mistress	626.3763
Milady seemed overcome with joy	1952.3348
And to all these questions	2606.2715
Finally as the hour for	1160.6522
Kittys detention was not long	13.1824
Hardly had DArtagnan seen through	1043.0774
What is that noise demanded	20.0941
It is I said DArtagnan	1098.9983
Count Count added she you	1491.7311
If rage or sorrow ever	1199.3114
DArtagnan was in a dolorous	62.4779
Jealousy gnawed his heart and	1059.1504
Yes Count said Milady in	887.5938
I alsoI love you <PAD>	11.7472
Oh tomorrow tomorrow I must	474.2916
DArtagnan remembered having seen this	1284.8468
The first movement of DArtagnan	130.3192
Keep that ring for love	16.7382
Besides in accepting it she	993.7938
At that instant he felt	47.4101
He even opened his mouth	761.0234
Oh continued Milady do your	1053.8472
Be tranquil murmured Milady I	2985.9373
This woman exercised over him	519.1605
He would not have believed	1500.9761
Presently it sounded one oclock	12.9348
It was necessary to separate	12.3357
DArtagnan at the moment of	1315.9692
Poor Kitty hoped to speak	1837.3330
The next morning DArtagnan ran	29.5218
He was engaged in an	117.9086
He therefore told him all	11.5701
Your Milady said he appears	1026.4326
In one fashion or another	1492.7386
You notice my ring said	669.4598
Yes said Athos it reminds	326.6476
Yes said Athos magnificent <PAD>	9.0986
I did not think two	121.8868
Have you traded it for	29.6731
It is a gift from	1671.1750
Her very self she gave	41.0977
Here it is replied DArtagnan	37.8965
Athos examined it and became	21.8941
He tried it on his	193.9323
A shade of anger and	316.4054
It is impossible it can	23.4294
How could this ring come	90.0404
And yet it is difficult	1664.1050
I thought I did replied	983.4071
Pray DArtagnan said Athos after	2311.1191
Dont ask me for counsel	135.9974
But stop <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.8745
let me look at that	943.8651
Athos started <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.6953
Look said he is it	213.0972
But from whom did this	566.3150
As I told you it	404.9487
No replied Athos with a	19.7336
I gave it away in	542.9150
He took back the ring	158.8988
DArtagnan said Athos taking his	385.3951
Take my advice renounce this	21.8538
I do not know her	679.1319
I own that this woman	133.0129
I shall replied DArtagnan and	1292.0203
On reaching home DArtagnan found	55.9881
A month of fever could	557.2871
She was sent by her	79.7884
Her mistress was mad with	54.2143
She wished to know when	1720.6404
The counsels of his friend	1131.9265
As a reply he wrote	473.3068
Since my convalescence I have	1021.5377
When your turn comes I	83.6374
I kiss your hands <PAD>	10.8916
COMTE DE WARDES Not a	77.2483
Was the Gascon determined to	1280.2546
It would be wrong to	368.0720
That which would now be	892.0744
DArtagnan gave the open letter	993.5172
She could scarcely believe in	901.1475
And whatever might beconsidering the	3284.6030
The heart of the best	156.3509
Milady opened the letter with	1167.8488
She crushed the paper in	1286.6616
Impossible cried Milady <PAD> <PAD>	8.3844
It is impossible a gentleman	919.5053
can he have and she	11.3176
She ground her teeth she	61.5894
She tried to go toward	1562.8236

DREAM OF VENGEANCE That evening	3063.7539
The next day Kitty went	497.5067
DArtagnan smiled this jealous anger	74.1001
That evening Milady was still	121.6806
She renewed the order relative	228.9503
The next morning when Kitty	2112.3586
DArtagnan asked the poor girl	526.2110
This letter was in Miladys	1014.7873
He opened it and read	2367.8040
My brotherinlaw and myself expected	128.3948

Your very grateful MILADY CLARIK	517.8444
My credit rises by the	715.5681
Listen to me my dear	582.9384
Milady not seeing me come	787.5315
You are going now to	616.3257
DArtagnan reassured her as well	510.8592
He desired Kitty to tell	1006.6473
He did not dare to	1864.9307
As nine oclock sounded DArtagnan	65.8977
It was evident that the	800.9268
Show him in said Milady	431.3237
He was introduced <PAD> <PAD>	7.0241
I am at home to	322.9031
DArtagnan cast an inquiring glance	34.3427
She was pale and looked	132.6770
The number of lights had	1404.0157
DArtagnan approached her with his	24.6431
She then made an extraordinary	1044.7968
To the questions which DArtagnan	2224.6228
On the contrary stay Monsieur	550.4001
She has never been so	21.3294
On guard Milady assumed the	964.0685
At the same time the	966.6846
DArtagnan was again in the	276.5152
His love which he believed	421.6959
Milady smiled and DArtagnan felt	104.3737
There was a moment at	50.7460
By degrees Milady became more	33.8862
She asked DArtagnan if he	21.1368
Alas said DArtagnan with the	1064.1200
Then you love me said	11.9548
Have I any need to	19.8480
Have you not perceived it	704.5767
I shrink before nothing but	2529.7095
The devil thought DArtagnan <PAD>	9.7932
The note is changed <PAD>	10.6282
Is she going to fall	930.1299
Well now she said let	552.6426
Order I am ready For	1131.2256
Well now let us talk	1680.3235
I am all attention madame	17.7175
Milady remained thoughtful and undecided	798.9399
May I reckon on you	1327.1541
You may madame said he	20.7346
My arm and my life	786.5520
Well demanded DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	7.5965
Well replied Milady after a	1489.0220
Avenge me of that infamous	1682.2732
I am ready said he	9.8703
You have understood me then	55.1856
I could interpret one of	1429.9792
I know these lovers <PAD>	10.7995
They are men who do	456.8044
She scarcely resisted <PAD> <PAD>	9.5171
Interested man cried she smiling	12.0049
Ah cried DArtagnan really carried	1131.3329
Quite certain said Milady with	29.9907
Only name to me the	722.8663
It appeared to me Such	120.3617
So much the better <PAD>	7.9744
Come tell me his name	736.0621
What is his name You	1185.0072
If it were one of	992.9540
Not if it were my	243.1574
Our Gascon promised this without	118.4391
I love your devotedness said	23.9287
Alas do you love nothing	39.2566
I love you also you	36.5335
The warm pressure made DArtagnan	1271.3484
You love me you cried	11.9968
Oh if that were so	228.7871
She made no effort to	588.0649
Her lips were cold it	129.1856
He was not the less	79.4523
He almost believed in the	468.7420
If De Wardes had at	225.8285
Milady seized the occasion <PAD>	9.5036
His name is said she	20.3115
De Wardes I know it	21.6034
And how do you know	725.5671
DArtagnan felt he had allowed	262.3357
Tell me tell me tell	611.1587
Yes I know it because	999.5386
The epithet as may be	314.3243
Well continued she <PAD> <PAD>	6.6822
Well I will avenge you	1017.8685
Thanks my brave friend cried	1748.6836
Besides she had a thousand	871.7013
All this was answered by	31.9933
Tomorrow said he you will	504.8856
He is a coward With	67.6361
I know something of him	751.3033
But would it be just	649.1183
Oh you are an angel	27.8099
Then all is agreed said	13.7149
Except that which I ask	601.2095
I hear my brother <PAD>	9.9208
It will be useless for	365.3013
Go out this way said	1351.7806
Kitty will conduct you to	345.7944
Well mademoiselle what are you	104.2428
Do as I bid you	1021.8519
But said he as he	825.1095
This woman is certainly a	26.3375
I must take care Chapter	24.5266
MILADYS SECRET DArtagnan left the	1977.5122
What was most clear in	756.5859
In an instant DArtagnan perceived	700.7396
But he also was spurred	94.6851
He wished to subdue this	594.0338
He walked six or seven	1519.1841
It was evident that this	533.7712
At length the light disappeared	12.7485
With this light was extinguished	91.1800
He recalled to his mind	607.1913
The poor girl pale as	1469.7957
He imagined himself to be	532.2250
He however darted not the	3616.6521
As the door closed after	60.2994
Jealousy fury offended pride all	2274.0620
This last thought of love	109.1928
DArtagnan on his part had	66.5587
It was no longer a	244.7984
A secret voice whispered to	573.5793
And then our Gascon with	1832.2158
He was absorbed entirely by	42.7936
Milady was no longer for	670.0829
Two hours thus glided away	17.7156
When the transports of the	1184.9502
But DArtagnan whose ideas had	1626.4741
This coldness toward the only	1157.1879
Then DArtagnan who had never	1076.2241
Milady kept him within the	833.4498
DArtagnan fancied himself very cunning	5109.6104
But at the first word	992.6714
This reassured her <PAD> <PAD>	8.0327
We can not say how	948.2666
Seeing DArtagnan about to leave	624.1766
I am quite ready said	500.5611
That is whether you really	450.5613
Is it not so Certainly	508.8173
The pale light of the	542.3983
Really said she I believe	832.6486
I think that a man	854.7020
At least I am now	826.7510
Yes I And why you	919.0810
Yes I am a man	490.3850
This confession said she growing	2834.3079
It is not true said	772.8887
Do not lie my angel	264.0529
Speak <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8409

what next De Wardes can	129.3239
You told me yourself that	60.5006
The Comte de Wardes of	1152.7418
Pale and trembling Milady repulsed	2605.0886
It was almost broad daylight	16.4669
DArtagnan detained her by her	2363.1262
Then the cambric was torn	1461.4003
Great God cried DArtagnan loosing	536.1747
But Milady felt herself denounced	68.3122
He had doubtless seen all	11.8407
The young man now knew	1849.0999
She turned upon him no	269.2803
Ah wretch cried she you	247.6304
You shall die And she	1505.2299
Although the young man was	1795.5999
He recoiled to the other	740.9577
But without taking any heed	1324.0643
She then tried to seize	941.2861
Milady during this time continued	488.4287
As all this however bore	599.9417
Well beautiful lady very well	1738.9474
But DArtagnan still keeping on	130.6125
At the noise they made	1017.3751
DArtagnan who had unceasingly maneuvered	582.9429
With one spring he flew	1337.0956
Then Milady attempted to tear	1696.3942
Every blow was accompanied with	30.4410
Quick Kitty quick said DArtagnan	1146.1302
But dress me as well	1330.4933
In a turn of the	992.7509
She gave him some slippers	650.0584
It was time <PAD> <PAD>	5.9503
Milady had already rung her	120.2049

He crossed the court ran	1174.9146
Grimaud came rubbing his halfopen	1901.9208
In spite of his habitual	179.4657
Holloa there cried he what	42.0391
Whats your business here you	1893.9576

Hold your tongue you stupid	219.9767
Where is your master You	1144.6206
Athos recognized his comrade and	1090.5857
Dont laugh my friend cried	1705.2009
How pale you are No	120.1022
Are you alone Athos Parbleu	853.7298

Come come tell me I	1441.5775
DArtagnan donned the robe as	1774.5697
Well said Athos <PAD> <PAD>	6.0301
Well replied DArtagnan bending his	2237.7908

Yes she of whom you	958.1447
This is a woman of	1813.6948
She has lost a tooth	1609.9967

You tried to kill her	463.2614
Did you ever see her	35.2310
A tigress a panther <PAD>	14.0085
Ah my dear Athos I	1132.8779
You are right and upon	214.2067
Fortunately the day after tomorrow	26.7923
We are going according to	955.7864
Let her then exhaust her	1275.4562
Do you perchance think I	2214.6030
If the cardinal does not	1029.6296
If you go out do	210.3072
Mistrust everything in short even	1642.1495
You must return to the	907.3920
Grimaud entered <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.2876
Athos made him a sign	214.1904
Grimaud replied by another sign	82.0551
All this will not advance	567.9110
Fortunately you have the sapphire	92.1384
Did you not tell me	764.3339
It formed part of the	170.7813
My mother gave it to	774.7070
Never that ring is defiled	695.3926
I vow I should consider	1702.2974
With that sum you can	922.7944
You are a capital companion	810.0032
Well let us pledge the	1314.5505

What do I want <PAD>	8.0167
A horse for Planchet thats	18.1650
Besides you forget that I	925.4877
It is not only a	879.0062
Let us return to my	45.2773
You shall take half the	656.4628
At this moment Grimaud returned	1023.9644
DArtagnan dressed himself and Athos	21.5512
When the two were ready	460.5597
They arrived without accident at	55.2556
Bonacieux was standing at the	52.5705

Sure enough <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5037
Upon the landing leading to	728.6317

Remember it is you who	752.4689
But what happened after my	109.4183
The lackeys were brought by	40.6966
She was mad with passion	13.4324
There exist no imprecations she	98.2394
Then I thought she would	815.6989
Poor dear girl <PAD> <PAD>	7.3226
But what can I do	13.3780
I am going away the	180.7479
Help me out of Paris	518.4193

I can manage your business	21.1433
Planchet go and find Aramis	10.8938
Request him to come here	14.8196
We have something very important	196.1059
I should have thought that	1077.0594
Besides Kitty would not like	128.7954
Isnt it so Kitty I	1507.6053
And I also said DArtagnan	15.9913
I shall always love you	27.9987
But now answer me <PAD>	8.8404
I attach great importance to	106.9117
Did you never hear talk	335.6827
Oh Monsieur Chevalier do you	1098.0717

You know the interest we	130.6370

He has gone said he	519.6776
Aramis whom we have sent	800.5049
The matter was all explained	672.9905
Aramis reflected for a minute	1116.4736
Madame de BoisTracy asked me	1322.4629
If you can my dear	717.0211
And now my dear girl	342.9076
Therefore let us separate <PAD>	10.7822
We shall meet again in	1564.2424
An instant afterward the three	1457.1176
Aramis returned home and Athos	224.0314
As the Gascon had foreseen	214.0940
Still further the Jew told	1053.0283
Athos and DArtagnan with the	1290.5123
Besides Athos was very easy	83.0074
When a thing suited him	554.3127
DArtagnan would have remonstrated at	707.5934
The Musketeer met with a	6784.8394
He examined him and found	53.0245
They asked a thousand livres	20.2333
He might perhaps have been	1376.3522
Grimaud had a stout short	256.1076
But when the saddle and	794.8777
DArtagnan offered his friend a	181.1977
But Athos only replied to	75.7303
How much did the Jew	377.5804
Five hundred pistoles That is	948.7469
Well now that would be	785.1089

A VISION At four oclock	163.1261
Their anxiety about their outfits	2556.6477
Suddenly Planchet entered bringing two	36.5659

The other was a large	642.9858
At the sight of the	579.4695
He therefore seized the little	56.9053
Be said the letter on	806.4422
Thats a snare said Athos	957.1282
Between six and seven oclock	918.7844
They wont devour us all	1976.0153
But if it is a	887.8232
They must be enemies He	54.0585
Besides we must try our	2288.0244

Gentlemen said DArtagnan it is	577.8456

Whatever may ensue I will	637.8768
Bah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8473
you will get me out	61.1351
To be sure we will	1159.0771
Let each of us wait	801.1755
It is a long time	856.6699
What do you think of	177.8666
Well said Porthos I will	1494.3481
Meantime you see that the	487.2814

Certes cried Athos you are	1521.6440
I can not comprehend what	502.3614
The third then fell from	664.5726

Well in that case we	928.4169

At the same time Aramis	710.7925
Bazin followed him upon a	1237.6212
The two Musketeers met at	24.5153
Athos and DArtagnan watched their	33.4662

A bad joke of the	1303.1450
DArtagnan and Athos put themselves	1386.1453
The lackeys followed <PAD> <PAD>	8.8820
As Porthos had foreseen the	187.3655
Coquenard had met Porthos and	1259.2335
Near the Louvre the four	1186.9028
DArtagnan profited by the circumstance	678.8875
It is well understood that	98.8916
M de Trville approved of	798.0535
At this moment the clock	1501.5159
A short gallop brought them	1579.5146
DArtagnan keeping at some distance	1656.2275
At length after waiting a	1397.2015
A presentiment instantly told DArtagnan	997.7862
Almost instantly a female head	1821.7461
DArtagnan uttered a slight cry	977.1137
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
By an involuntary movement and	837.2791
DArtagnan then remembered the injunction	1167.7296
The carriage pursued its way	781.5560
DArtagnan remained fixed to the	103.1574
If it was Mme <PAD>	9.9376
Bonacieux and if she was	1339.5199
If on the other side	1193.7524
His three companions joined him	15.3503
All had plainly seen a	1077.9333
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
The opinion of Athos was	716.5395
If that be the case	272.4622
But what can they intend	921.5961
You know something of that	43.9063
Now if your mistress is	572.1338
And perhaps my God added	1418.6650
The carriage had been twenty	52.0528
DArtagnans friends reminded him that	670.3411
But DArtagnan was at the	40.4055
He had made up his	587.7369
Nothing could turn him from	20.4272
They reached the Rue St	2448.1753
There only they explained to	37.0147
DArtagnan was well known among	977.8693
It resulted from these antecedents	1774.3979
Athos divided them into three	769.9442
DArtagnan on his part entered	57.9811
Although he felt himself ably	1001.5869
His conduct toward Milady bore	2717.9360
Still further De Wardes whom	1354.1083
If De Wardes has related	806.6707
But why has he waited	23.2563
Thats all plain enough <PAD>	10.8840
Milady has laid her complaints	2279.6218
Nevertheless Monsieur de Trvilles company	2214.8733
DArtagnan my friend you are	991.8458
He placed his letter in	638.5560
In this waiting room were	846.9786
This smile appeared to DArtagnan	45.2422
Only as our Gascon was	1099.1890
The usher returned and made	66.9504
It appeared to the young	348.6004
He traversed a corridor crossed	1402.4847
The usher introduced him and	67.4459
DArtagnan remained standing and examined	21.5035
DArtagnan at first believed that	542.9882

Monsieur said the cardinal are	172.1744
There are several branches of	926.3911
It is you who set	1079.4657
I dont very well know	1161.0608
You were recommended to Monsieur	1484.7914
But Monsieur de Trville is	1224.4910
Since that time many things	28.2175
You were walking one day	594.9664
Then you took with your	627.8503
That is all very simple	2095.9851
I know because it is	40.9830
On your return you were	1260.3081
The day after that you	116.4483
He went to desire you	29.3629
You have not returned that	1590.6791
Could you incur my displeasure	1529.2882
It is the people who	530.3771
As a proof remember the	495.4329
Bonacieux took place <PAD> <PAD>	7.1466
DArtagnan trembled and he likewise	1130.4906
In short continued the cardinal	482.9822
Besides you owe me some	17.0699
You must yourself have remarked	565.1345
That continued the cardinal arose	1241.9172
I wished to explain this	565.6115
Fortunately nothing is lost by	117.6991
Sit down there before me	905.8936
You are brave Monsieur dArtagnan	249.7147
I like men of head	17.0639
Dont be afraid said he	14.8354
By men of heart I	31.9542
But young as you are	644.0367
Yet you have need I	875.5312
There are no extravagant hopes	261.5176
Now what would you say	1704.8562
How <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8495
You refuse cried the cardinal	21.0957
I am in his Majestys	1065.3070
I comprehend <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0084
Well you have this excuse	779.2507
As regards yourself the need	1012.4465
You do not consecrate your	311.6921
In fact said the cardinal	1164.8433
I know you to be	688.2585
Come reflect and decide Your	2246.1423
Yes speak Then I will	704.3657
Monseigneur your Eminence is a	591.7503

I shall serve under the	572.9495
Everything is best in its	22.8103
Hereafter perhaps I shall have	700.9321
We owe nothing to our	1049.9763
Remember at a later period	1229.0989
I will have my eye	451.4069
Remain neutral monseigneur if you	1817.5803
The cardinal then was seeking	172.2270
He opened his mouth to	229.5596
DArtagnan went out but at	305.7177
Then the noble and severe	639.5989
It was this fear that	1009.5184
DArtagnan descended by the staircase	590.6678
With a word DArtagnan reassured	1070.4030
Returned home with Athos Aramis	1077.2402
And you were right cried	43.9558
Athos fell into a profound	43.0488
But when they were alone	448.1313
The whole of the next	86.4427
DArtagnan went to take leave	35.5307
At that time it was	683.2897
M de Trville contented himself	819.3176
That night brought together all	1327.7496
They were parting to meet	227.8564
That night then was somewhat	74.2373
In such cases extreme preoccupation	295.9708
At the first sound of	1239.2740
Each of the captains then	301.5586
The king was dull and	445.4693
In fact the evening before	685.3179
He had not the less	706.3508
The review over the Guards	2105.2937
The procurators wife saw him	253.4363
She loved Porthos too dearly	978.5582
Porthos was magnificent his spurs	1559.2231
This time the clerks evinced	972.9317
The Musketeer was introduced to	4618.7905
Nevertheless one thing afforded him	1263.2274
He whispered a hope to	271.2787
Porthos paid his compliments to	103.7569
M Coquenard wished him all	55.3090
As to Mme <PAD> <PAD>	7.9508
Coquenard she could not restrain	1253.9540
But the real adieux were	39.2007
Coquenards chamber they were heartrending	17.0523
As long as the procurators	1430.3972
Porthos received all these attentions	996.6227
On his part Aramis wrote	28.9266
To whom <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.1945
Nobody knew <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.3890
Kitty who was to set	188.5672
Athos sipped the last bottle	47.6313
In the meantime DArtagnan was	40.4719
Arriving at the Faubourg St	1469.5763
To a look of interrogation	236.6331
Then certain that there could	658.5590
The two men followed the	2526.4463

THE SIEGE OF LA ROCHELLE	3978.5793
It is then interesting and	1033.6547
The political plans of the	190.5483
Let us unfold them first	1063.7679
Of the important cities given	63.7877
to the Huguenots as places	156.1667
It became necessary therefore to	3886.6492
Spaniards Englishmen and Italian malcontents	3885.7263
La Rochelle which had derived	1752.4666
Moreover its port was the	730.7604
Thus Bassompierre who was at	1798.8831
The cannonade of the Isle	1963.1683
We have hinted that by	1204.5325
Richelieu as everyone knows had	28.3500
Was this love a simple	1959.7144
That we are not able	982.3732
It was then Richelieus object	962.8359
Richelieu knew that in combating	3893.1189
On his side Buckingham in	1354.6042
Buckingham also was pursuing a	28.6557
Buckingham could not under any	1558.5364
It resulted from this that	1979.8539
The first advantage had been	39.0076
Arriving unexpectedly in sight of	2045.4772
Allow us to observe in	1593.1636

The Comte de Toiras retired	2604.8701
This event had hastened the	419.4886
It was of this detachment	272.5322
The king as we have	685.9146
He was notwithstanding anxious to	1303.1649
Now whenever the king halted	45.5277
It followed that DArtagnan who	776.7458
This separation which was no	1544.5175
He however arrived without accident	1754.3629
Everything was in the same	11.9163
The Duke of Buckingham and	2201.8926
The Guards under the command	1918.7517
His reflections were not very	21.5758
From the time of his	956.5333
As to love the only	77.7020
Bonacieux and Mme <PAD> <PAD>	7.9901
Bonacieux had disappeared without his	122.5335
As to fortune he had	649.8145
That man had the power	104.7606
For a mind so perspicuous	749.9432
Then he had made himself	876.1827
This enemy was Milady <PAD>	11.2940
In exchange for all this	392.3127
Bonacieux <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8463
What he had clearly gained	1189.9408
We say the gravel he	2856.8835
Now these reflections had led	1002.7457
DArtagnan had a quick eye	42.0006
He comprehended that the musket	643.7371
He determined therefore to direct	637.2499
This was evidently an ambuscade	14.6885
The young man cast a	745.2182
At the same instant the	533.3372
No time was to be	11.8413
DArtagnan sprang up with a	949.5870
DArtagnan was not one of	710.4384
Besides courage was out of	149.5254
If there is a third	543.3021
As he however had no	905.2925
He sat down without saying	131.9468
This event might have three	775.9699
DArtagnan took his hat examined	183.6511
The ball was not a	108.7900
The accuracy of the aim	560.5602
This could not then be	331.4843
This might be a kind	45.0561
It may be observed that	576.0522
But DArtagnan again shook his	16.5399
For people toward whom he	987.5423
It might be a vengeance	68.9013
He tried in vain to	817.9923
Ah my poor friends murmured	31.7738
And that you should fail	74.9520
Three or four times he	1046.7990
Nevertheless day dawned without darkness	71.0868
But DArtagnan well suspected that	102.1617
DArtagnan remained all day in	416.5451
At nine oclock the next	83.9998
The Duc dOrlans visited the	30.9681
The guards were under arms	195.0422
Monsieur passed along the front	1540.8336
At the expiration of a	783.4283
He waited for a fresh	943.1979
Monsieur is about to ask	613.1561
In fact the Rochellais had	1319.8976
The matter was to ascertain	190.5087
At the end of a	626.6515
Two of his comrades of	1664.7939
DArtagnan declined all others being	431.5457
It was not known whether	1061.0890
DArtagnan set out with his	1165.6500
They arrived thus screened by	1393.0085
There on turning round DArtagnan	80.3050
He thought that beginning to	234.4029
At the turning of the	344.4170
They saw no one and	39.6519
The three composing our forlorn	3341.4993
They knew all they wished	62.8432
A longer stay in this	138.6367
DArtagnan and his two companions	407.0193
On arriving at the angle	877.2881
A ball had passed through	24.3600
The other who was safe	103.7786
DArtagnan was not willing to	1306.6512
One ball struck the head	1803.9940
The young man turned quickly	834.6685
The idea of the two	687.0351
He resolved this time to	543.7521
He quickly saw two heads	1692.4926
DArtagnan had not been deceived	818.9012
As he might be only	798.7053
Fortunately deceived by DArtagnans trick	172.3224
When they were within ten	789.7396
The assassins comprehended that if	1925.2826
One of them took his	236.2251
He aimed a terrible blow	1194.5206
As the Rochellais who guarded	997.6074
Meantime DArtagnan had thrown himself	156.8895
The conflict was not long	480.6867
The sword of the Guardsman	1599.9048
DArtagnan immediately placed the point	55.1994
Oh do not kill me	24.1076
Pardon pardon my officer and	759.2014
Yes if you think existence	587.8602
Who employed you to assassinate	1250.3417
It was with him she	389.7969
A hundred louis <PAD> <PAD>	8.3898
Well that was a temptation	46.3742
I understand why you accepted	634.3670
That you will go and	586.2050
How can I go and	974.0485
In the name of that	401.9564
And how do you know	557.9495
By that letter which my	510.6042
So no more delay no	1900.2972
Stop stop cried he regaining	74.1600
I will goI will go	1161.1654
It was a frightful thing	891.2525
Terror was so strongly painted	1316.6151
Stay where you are I	841.0167
There were two means of	1672.0973
DArtagnan preferred the second means	643.5710
A slight shock the dull	2879.6021
DArtagnan regained the trench and	475.6469
Then he began to search	11.0173
A leather pocketbook a purse	815.8899
He left the box and	988.2993
Among some unimportant papers he	962.8801
If you do you know	847.0658
Nevertheless it was plain the	37.0387
He consequently kept it as	1152.2874
He confessed that he had	1403.9896
But what were you to	68.0435
We were to have conveyed	255.4633
Yes yes murmured DArtagnan thats	3724.2471
There could be no doubt	81.4816
But amid all this he	724.4896
Bonacieux was explaining her devotion	670.1318
Then also as Athos had	126.7094
Bonacieux and a convent was	20.4177
This idea completely restored clemency	41.8763
He turned toward the wounded	1388.7817
Lean upon me and let	719.1046
The Guardsman who had returned	282.1824
They were therefore much astonished	877.7576
DArtagnan explained the sword wound	198.2386
He described the death of	127.4775
This recital was for him	58.7405
The whole army talked of	478.7442
Besides this as every great	1726.3900
In fact DArtagnan believed that	779.8533
This tranquillity proved one thingthat	129.5642

THE ANJOU WINE After the	3327.6372
Meantime Monsieur who knew that	578.6414
DArtagnan as we have said	1541.2473
He only felt one uneasiness	218.0177
But one morning at the	1034.0854
Athos Porthos and Aramis after	1540.6007
They are desirous that you	172.6666
I have done this and	2937.4795
They think of me in	135.2399
Well I will certainly drink	772.4443
One of the two Guardsmen	540.4805
DArtagnan on his return sent	1037.7754
Planchet very proud of being	1075.7639
The hour of the banquet	920.1593
Planchet waited towel on arm	2680.8735
Of this wine the first	1561.6213
The guests having eaten the	1136.1270
The Guardsmen imagining this to	1814.2554
DArtagnan not less forward than	870.4211
But scarcely were they out	317.6860
Cries of Live the king	11.9302
Live the cardinal resounded on	233.5222
In short the king impatient	840.7396
His Musketeers proceeded and followed	19.4446
DArtagnan placed in line with	1611.7949
The ceremony of reception over	197.5956
Pardieu cried DArtagnan you could	531.1520
Can it gentlemen added the	314.1952
Ah ah said Porthos it	1458.3408
Well pardieu there is yours	53.4233
Our wine said Athos astonished	13.2054
Yes that you sent me	1631.1536
Not exactly it is the	539.6448
Did you send this wine	24.6075
No and you Porthos No	317.2555
Our purveyor Yes your purveyor	314.3405
never mind where it comes	780.8881
Did none of you charge	253.4926
And yet you say he	515.4645
This is not his writing	15.7950
I am acquainted with it	1676.0311
Thou alarmest me said Athos	2452.9275
Can this be another vengeance	168.8895
DArtagnan rushed toward the refreshment	271.3650
The first object that met	1042.3207
Planchet and Fourreau as pale	1115.9707
Ah cried he on perceiving	23.1541
this is frightful <PAD> <PAD>	7.0801
You pretend to pardon me	64.6741
I wretch <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0425
What do you say I	239.2132
I say you wished to	820.0004
I swear to you I	64.4638
God will punish you <PAD>	9.0374
My God grant that he	1806.0450
Frightful <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8500
frightful murmured Athos while Porthos	1339.0505
Oh my friends said DArtagnan	581.9661
Gentlemen continued he addressing the	363.7923
Great personages may have had	939.6452
you were going to drink	659.3885
When the young Guardsman and	1317.8097
In the first place said	918.9197
Let him be interred in	27.4428
