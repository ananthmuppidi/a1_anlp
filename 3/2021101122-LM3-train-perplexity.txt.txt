The Shade of Cardinal Richelieu	17.7904
In a splendid chamber of	1610.0520
Behind this figure glowed a	7609.6172
Any one who happened at	2613.5256
It was alas <PAD> <PAD>	7.2014
the ghost of former greatness	18.6747
France enfeebled the authority of	4582.6411
In truth that the red	1748.0566
The shade of Richelieu was	17.3850
Now Mazarin was alone and	45.6839
Foreigner he ejaculated Italian <PAD>	11.0712
that is their mean yet	3079.6370
Idiots <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8497
ignorant of their real enemies	1086.5634
Yes yes Mazarin continued whilst	2412.3445
No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8453
The Earl of Essex tis	4591.5347
The parliament <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9203
We shall soon see how	70.1738
Both Orleans and Montargis are	24.6197
It will be a work	421.9443
will finish by shouting out	411.7614
It is said that Mazarin	933.0903
Richelieu whom they hated during	1695.5961
Often he was driven away	232.2112
The queen will never banish	905.5735
Oh were I not a	12.9453
were I but a Frenchman	10.0967
were I but of gentle	997.9390
Discontent had long pervaded the	85.2100
Crushed and impoverished by taxationimposed	2351.1919
Patience had in vain been	2729.6721
Had this been all it	1349.6211
Now the following occurrences had	136.4732
On the seventh of January	2553.3267
They deputed ten of their	1597.0731
The duke received them and	890.0396
They were listened to with	1283.4838
This man named Emery was	1444.9062
He was the son of	1692.7145
under his assumed name in	310.6009
You surprise me exclaimed the	16.8777
I am rejoiced to hear	1368.4436
I was really afraid that	1834.4722
It is not for nothing	390.0836
This was the same Emery	119.7323
He was sent for by	672.5211
The mob had insulted him	1783.5023
This lady was the daughter	1512.8364
The fact was that Emerys	1431.0522
Nothing therefore was settled that	1036.1141
On the next day Mathieu	3144.4053
The people threatened to hold	208.2339
But the chief president had	2535.2488
To which the others had	863.1715
Nor was this all <PAD>	7.1205
On the eleventh the queen	1183.6959
These poor creatures had no	32.0666
They wished only to be	973.1707
At length parliament was convoked	139.3346
One dayit was the morning	1393.2417
He took the opportunity of	902.3300
After mass the young monarch	2538.3528
The king returned amidst the	175.8631
All minds were uneasy most	340.0327
At first indeed they were	1270.2728
For the people had learned	1152.6309
All attempts to disperse the	616.6797
Orders had just been given	800.5091
He was shown in directly	1392.1792
Deliberations were being held when	1130.3569
The queen on seeing him	214.1117
As the mayor had foreseen	148.0229
The tocsin was sounded <PAD>	12.6283
Comminges had arrested one of	1090.1738
They broke open the doors	101.0889
Comminges wounded by a stone	652.8557
This account confirmed that of	22.7196
The authorities were not in	123.5269
Mazarin endeavored to circulate among	1087.6774
In fact about four oclock	1539.3069
Such was the state of	826.7963
We have seen in what	735.4047
All at once he raised	905.6262
A door hidden in the	1173.6993
Bernouin said the cardinal not	692.3522
The cardinal in deep thought	807.9633
When he was completely dressed	1012.3234
When he was left alone	267.2722
Still youngfor he was scarcely	2527.8960
After a short time the	1237.1598
At this instant the door	13.6589
Monsieur dArtagnan said the valetdechambre	12.0777
An officer as he spoke	25.8703
He was a man between	1623.1526
DArtagnan advanced a few steps	27.8378
How perfectly he remembered his	75.2268
Seeing however no one there	1031.7440
The lieutenant remained standing in	1380.5970
The cardinal looked at him	1144.3942
Mazarin gazed once more at	1093.2760
Sir resumed the cardinal you	302.2167
I wish to visit in	1191.2483
Every one likes his own	1683.0531
this is modesty indeed cried	18.3471
Had I such a uniform	1234.7711
Give me my felt hat	1761.1268
The cardinal put it on	31.7926
Your horses are ready saddled	211.2590

In ten minutes Mazarin and	4902.4805
The appearance of the town	47.8650
Numberless groups paraded the streets	870.8562
From time to time noises	114.0229
The report of firearms was	2788.1887
DArtagnan meantime pursued his way	1029.8330
When he approached a group	554.1581
The cardinal envied that composure	1651.3375
On approaching an outpost near	2876.1685
The soldier replied by pointing	880.3317
Here was the officer DArtagnan	16.7374
Here is Monsieur Comminges said	37.3634
He instantly retired from a	1415.2529

Come Guitant come along and	2259.9863
Just so muttered Comminges looking	27.5553
True I forgot provided he	850.5709
They pitied the young king	1431.8665
Addresses to the Duke of	60.3816
Blancmesnil and Broussel seemed in	28.6082
DArtagnan passed through the very	674.6111
Mazarin and Guitant conversed together	33.8923
The musketeers who had already	128.2985
In the street of Saint	400.7289

He led the way toward	62.7095

Villequier said Guitant <PAD> <PAD>	7.1653
Diavolo <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8481
Speak to him yourself for	730.3079

The king could not give	694.1664

People cry out Long live	25.4029

Adieu Au revoir <PAD> <PAD>	11.3742
Remember your promise In five	863.5001
As they stopped at the	704.8784
DArtagnan let me confess to	820.1513
I had only to cry	499.0235
Come come cried Rochefort <PAD>	10.0005
Did we not swear friendship	13.4408
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
had any one but you	64.4552
Is it possible that Rochefort	187.9012
And he caused himself to	34.7548
Let M de Rochefort enter	1632.4880
As he had said it	426.3726
Rochefort rendered suspicious and cautious	1364.3168
As the door was closed	1244.7701
There was little change in	1864.2291
But Rochefort who had passed	828.6818
As he gazed at him	758.9965
You are in prison then	148.1416
But I thought he said	176.6478
Oh no <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.9359
There is a congestion of	667.8488
I fancy I remember it	12.0928
Did you not once refuse	174.0036
ah exclaimed Rochefort <PAD> <PAD>	7.7677
There is the true reason	10.3103
Idiot that I am though	546.8267
I merely ask you did	690.8293
I was there at a	17.2194
I was sent there to	1106.8237
How could I then return	19.4955
I should injure the queen	1840.2616
Since I was a faithful	952.0021
I am but a minister	379.8252
Now the queen is of	23.7424
Hearing of your refusal to	816.9352
But your release can be	19.9327
You are one of those	1555.1689
I am a straightforward simple	83.3211
I am of a frankness	737.4892
Now to the point <PAD>	6.9860
I want friends I want	26.6919
When I say I want	49.6418
I do nothing without her	809.3820
So I shall never be	355.3195
I am disposed to believe	756.8840
Do not forget that I	675.2122
have I not told you	56.1670
The queencannot you make allowances	162.2887
But that has passed away	752.8583
mon Dieu <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1335
my dear Monsieur de Rochefort	12.9485
do you absolutely think that	110.2302
No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8453
We have had great annoyances	17.6156
As for me I play	360.6574
Let us come to some	16.7730
Are you one of us	692.8242
In the Bastile one talks	1036.6122

However there are plenty in	572.9952

I try to be beloved	1023.9180
the point aimed at by	31.3265
Richelieu who passed his life	2061.9861
I have known persons he	1273.8583
They had the misfortune to	702.2811
That Gascon has saved a	1667.5118
Then he will tell it	623.7592
Listen then returned Rochefort as	482.3405
Once upon a time there	1944.2709
Do not try my lord	581.2462
There came to the court	1134.0956
As these ornaments were given	1329.6865
There is no occasion to	747.8007
This illustrious queen had fallen	1901.2734
These four men were not	1407.3638
They were four honest soldiers	705.5500
They set out <PAD> <PAD>	7.1280
The minister knew of their	1222.0178
Three of them were overwhelmed	1730.8518
He crossed the sea and	731.1118
What do you think of	203.6816
Well I know of ten	103.7437
Five or six minutes elapsed	15.7894
You have nothing more to	53.5701
Yes <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8439
And you say that Monsieur	758.7548
They were his friends and	16.0846
He alone would have any	1170.0599
Well what is the matter	524.4157
What <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8407
impossible <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8527
And why is it impossible	582.8006
Have you forgotten my lord	510.9722
I congratulate you <PAD> <PAD>	7.2985
Your devotion does not commit	1145.3680
My lord I have been	656.9096
Employ me in any other	1424.3315
Believe me you ought now	27.2244
Here You decide then nothing	1121.7626
Call an officer of justice	280.6909
The officer entered <PAD> <PAD>	7.6224
Mazarin wrote a few words	104.8259
Adieu Monsieur de Rochefort he	13.6216
Rochefort bent low <PAD> <PAD>	8.4459
I see my lord I	833.4069
the friend of my greatest	18.1372
Dont suppose that you are	148.1583
I shall find many men	499.8875
He was then reconducted by	469.8795
In the courtyard the carriage	442.6913
Ah he muttered to himself	594.5079
Chapter IV <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0251
Anne of Austria at the	30.6357
When left alone with Bernouin	108.6064
He had gained much information	30.9885
Mazarin was a cheat at	21.2294
This is a detail preserved	46.5204
He called it using his	21.1726
He now determined not to	627.2276
My lord have you any	32.2995
Yes yes replied Mazarin <PAD>	9.5915
Light me I am going	227.7592
There was a secret communication	1011.8983
This secret passage is still	78.2393
In the bedroom in which	1767.6530
Anne reclining in a large	1569.4993
This celebrated woman fully understood	155.2385
It was her practice to	1283.6013
When Madame de Beauvais appeared	744.3882
Why he said does he	349.0556
The prime minister she said	1176.0293
How can you remember what	37.2356
You were too young to	473.1924
I know that I ought	577.8129
The king rose immediately took	838.0471
Mazarin contemplated these proceedings with	45.5097
They explained what had occurred	24.2004
He bowed respectfully to the	1286.0685
had entertained toward Mazarin and	254.0481
Anne of Austria sought to	1165.6589
The minister made a slight	872.3824
In a few minutes Laporte	37.1122
The child went directly to	57.9610
Well Louis said Anne why	773.6468
And the king went out	450.7906
Good said Mazarin I am	840.6146
Why it seems to me	166.9031
Besides his majesty takes no	239.2256
That however does not hinder	742.9587
But continued the queen you	80.4470
What is it then Mazarin	385.8016
It is likely he replied	986.6268
Alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8417
I do not madame rejoined	17.5290
Mark well what I say	10.1965
The whole world conspires to	51.5346

Come let us come to	16.4275
Do you know Monsieur de	1387.1458

No still there but I	359.1575

Anne of Austria received the	47.2366
Has the Gascon been indiscreet	125.1013
stop an instant the name	35.7854
DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
there was a musketeer who	64.1179
Poor young creature <PAD> <PAD>	7.7904
she was poisoned on my	122.7083
The queen looked at him	16.1077
You seem sir she remarked	1905.2639
Tell me your wishes and	241.5581
Well madame said Mazarin bowing	635.4657
The circumstances are grave and	277.2859
I thought that we were	1317.5496
There is however a proverb	710.7955
Well then madame not a	1232.9149
We have arrested Monsieur de	143.6937
There is the Prince de	65.6642
Do you think of him	1019.0724
The first prince of the	45.0418

But he is mistaken I	805.3550
What am I to do	137.3705
Endeavor to remember the names	1361.5079
I wish continued Mazarin finishing	851.1685
I thought that calumny was	1245.3893
I will tell you all	18.4351
Listen there were in truth	3528.8015
you confess it exclaimed Mazarin	12.8365
Is it only the guilty	117.4496
and can not women be	38.2121
Yes appearances were against me	82.7719
However I swear I was	927.2573
I am incredulous The queen	2017.4037
Open sir she said and	1093.4767
What are these things he	13.9765
What are these things replied	2909.6917
These two letters are the	72.8893
This knife is the knife	62.0170
Read the letters and see	1340.1511
The blade was red for	1909.6807
It is well madame I	1025.5216
Do you think she said	944.6170
In one the queen asked	38.2692
This letter had been conveyed	63.1631
The other was that which	523.3845
It is well madame said	1771.8369
It appears she resumed that	1785.2841
I bought it from him	38.0294
Give it back to him	548.9515
I will profit by the	898.1583
I love you so tenderly	1213.3854
Since you have no further	161.7231
I wish after such a	159.2406
I will retire madame <PAD>	10.1708
Do you permit me to	759.5113
Scarcely had he left her	611.6753
Laporte pointed to the child	23.1313
Anne ascended the steps side	1189.4235
Meanwhile the cardinal returned to	926.6216
When he was alone he	112.3049
There DArtagnan was asleep upon	23.1932
The cardinal went up to	40.1958
DArtagnan started awakened himself and	410.8317
Here I am said he	8.0895
Who calls me I said	59.5643
I ask pardon of your	1051.5381

Come come murmured DArtagnan Rochefort	931.0938
Monsieur dArtagnan said the cardinal	551.5972
Well continued Mazarin the time	1243.3707
Order my lord he said	1313.9722
It is true I fought	2370.5400
Well you do not reply	19.5303

Devil take him Then he	58.5317

In former days I had	1493.3132
Speak now the queen herself	771.2541
Yes the queen <PAD> <PAD>	5.6988
And as a proof of	651.7524
Tis true <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4666
I remember well that diamond	490.0655
Answer me without acting as	1098.2869
Come you are accounted for	302.2933
We have parted company this	1332.5586
I remember too well how	679.3149
Money <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8446

Pray are you aware that	474.2921
Sell the crown diamonds <PAD>	10.6596
Trust me dont let us	60.7566
Great undertakings come poorly off	2804.7795
Yes if my friends agree	864.3478
Go then and find them	783.7930
Adapt your promises to their	1662.6710
It is even probable that	59.7459
I am only a lieutenant	163.0421
My intention said Mazarin is	1109.9637
Well then all is settled	68.0820
Yes my lord Apropos what	1863.6434
Younger sons he said who	1260.2937
Long swords but light purses	18.0528
Was that it If God	830.7070
Crown pieces onlysilver pieces <PAD>	16.3611
I suspected it <PAD> <PAD>	7.4187
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
Mazarin <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8445
Mazarin <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8445
thou hast no confidence in	17.1853
so much the worse for	994.2996
A hundred pistoles <PAD> <PAD>	8.2899
a hundred pistoles <PAD> <PAD>	8.3008
for a hundred pistoles I	1396.2944
In the meantime DArtagnan took	949.0723
We will explain in a	429.1865
Chapter VI <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3905
DArtagnan in his Fortieth Year	15.8889
Years have elapsed many events	45.2478
since in our romance of	256.1706
Rue des Fossoyeurs <PAD> <PAD>	9.9934
DArtagnan had not failed in	137.6929
So long as he was	401.7136
He was one of those	648.4328
Athos imparted to him his	218.6234
Had DArtagnan continued his intimacy	292.9850
Athos was the first to	562.0478
From that day DArtagnan felt	1422.7065
Notwithstanding his commission in the	61.0488
For a time the delightful	2647.5251
A garrison life is fatal	2226.9980
His early refinement of character	1595.2305
These important advantages DArtagnan found	596.3329
From the time DArtagnan took	971.4135
He was thought to be	1702.1099
Therefore after the connection had	1438.0734
Ah fie DArtagnan replied <PAD>	11.3035
Bigamy my dear <PAD> <PAD>	6.2634
Come now you dont really	594.6907
my darling <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.5791
another way of getting hanged	2742.0066
She would have taken DArtagnan	481.8426
Then along toward the fourth	98.4762
DArtagnan was assigned to it	52.8526
There were then great griefs	1382.8319
DArtagnan was too grand to	807.0308
As to that we know	924.1801
He had been seen falling	713.4023
One believes readily what he	36.6128
Now in the army from	539.1669
But DArtagnan was not a	58.8557
After he had remained through	922.1350
He gained a village knocked	614.9988
He was petted tended cured	1625.2693
Once in France he turned	472.0854
But DArtagnan found in his	1078.9043
He has returned said he	9.4421
So much the worse and	423.4216
He made inquiries and discovered	407.9035
Alone asked DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	6.5056
With monsieur Monsieur has returned	132.7417
If I had any money	177.9967
I must stay and follow	2623.2205
see <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8481
here is madame returning with	1225.5564
Is that monsieur said DArtagnan	14.9453
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484

The hostess as she entered	1476.8934
The Swiss with an air	175.0251
Ah it is you monsieur	9.2237
What do you want of	50.6108
Is monsieur your cousin <PAD>	11.2163
Is monsieur your brother said	464.3027
And without waiting for her	1026.9340
Who is that man he	10.6898
The hostess replied only by	22.1118
Who is that Swiss asked	14.4480
Monsieur is going to marry	94.4748
Your husband then is at	202.8533
It concerns me much said	842.5669
And sinceI do not give	35.0572
The Swiss became as purple	44.1863
He wore his elegant uniform	1854.1582
Will you go away from	1373.5421
I <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8462
By no means said DArtagnan	10.8089
Some one must go for	838.4540
DArtagnan with a sudden accession	2013.6344
As for you illustrious descendant	1609.3689
I go out he said	9.4630
And why Ah very well	87.7258
Come then and take a	823.3982
DArtagnan turned toward her saying	1354.8472
who are you in the	288.5096
It was night when the	87.2164
DArtagnan politely begged the Swiss	1639.9155
Then you will lie here	18.1510
It is a wretched bed	517.7343
He had to contend against	351.5491
The Swiss received two wounds	1318.5281
There said DArtagnan what did	18.2287
Fortunately you wont be laid	55.5251
Remain here and I will	54.8008
Goodby <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8496
Oh by the way youd	928.6848
You will be well fed	84.5995
Adieu Thereupon he returned in	743.0182
The boy found him sitting	504.7161
The boy the hostess and	592.1364
But when he was alone	835.4453
As for you you have	33.8944
So much the worse for	369.3951
I have driven away the	297.4224
I will not sleep where	30.5366
Ho there boy <PAD> <PAD>	7.4481
Have my valise carried to	177.5505
Adieu madame In saying these	276.4405
The hostess threw herself at	615.5765
What more need be said	10.8092
The spit turned the stove	2496.0635
He pardoned and having pardoned	28.2270
And this explains how DArtagnan	487.7808
DArtagnan then returned home in	2888.2849
Should that diamond ever fall	976.9288
Then I should like to	546.6130
Faith <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8458
that would be a far	1617.0936
Oho said he is the	598.0497
The people were shouting and	56.3773
By the light of one	100.1361
He asked what was going	12.7887
He was told that twenty	1062.7878
In his youth DArtagnan had	2017.1815
There he found Madeleine alarmed	588.7745
He took his key and	88.1169
He had been contented for	1135.7858
His first care on entering	1120.3086
Not to reflect on what	57.2714
No DArtagnan considered that things	520.1603
He was hungry he supped	37.3303
Neither was he one of	314.3311
In the night he slept	1012.9082
It was long since he	735.9207
At daybreak he awoke and	64.5575
In he said just before	172.8172
Where was I then <PAD>	6.7595
Let me see <PAD> <PAD>	6.1393
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
at the siege of Besancon	42.8106
He told melet me thinkwhat	28.1949
That he was living on	39.3545
I was just reading the	670.1017
Let me see with regard	98.5301
He invited me to a	195.5654
Unluckily as I was then	292.6062
I had left Bearn when	820.4529
Let me look for this	1063.6326
He uttered an exclamation of	1724.4343
DArtagnan eagerly searched for the	513.6095
Porthos had forgotten that any	922.0594
Devil take the vain fellow	18.5174
However I had better find	112.6243
Athos must have become an	77.9279
Aramis must have worn himself	1636.6338
There was a postscript I	1106.0608
What convent <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0444
There are about two hundred	799.9688
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
if I were but learned	867.8483

He ran up the steps	1051.0043
Monsieur Bazin the beadle said	23.9178
Yes <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8439
There he is attending mass	1558.5824

The officiating priest was just	2336.6389
It was to this end	758.9425
A sacerdotal officer <PAD> <PAD>	9.2549
DArtagnan knelt as well as	632.4551
Bazin looked down and started	69.3564
Monsieur dArtagnan he cried Vade	1909.3911
You forget sir that you	560.3071
Age produces good sense and	776.7866

DArtagnan perceived that he was	72.7795
DArtagnan slipped out of the	981.6904
In five minutes Bazin made	923.7197
Calmed by appearances he ventured	168.6068
Then DArtagnan rushed out of	947.3857
Afraid of making any inquiries	717.6641
This beverage required a good	45.9763
And DArtagnan had time therefore	48.5997
He perceived in the tavern	1388.7745
He questioned him and as	1014.6639
Whilst he was talking to	222.0243

On entering the hotel DArtagnan	147.6366
It was Planchet but so	1207.5010
Madeleine introduced him in presence	29.3029
Planchet addressed the officer with	1107.5656
The plan adopted by DArtagnan	41.7266
He resolved not to reach	877.3115
He began his day by	2492.8818
A most active search was	1538.6002
At about a league and	696.1038
The inn was full of	1557.8431
A man wrapped in a	741.7955
DArtagnan on his side went	1668.2960
At four oclock DArtagnan recommenced	29.0218
He proceeded slowly and in	27.5575
Planchet also was lost in	156.2967
One word which their landlady	1224.9442
That name was indeed one	80.9152
Madame de Longueville was one	881.7218
She had formerly been suspected	1463.7520
She was now connected by	1145.9292
DArtagnan thought of all these	15.0979
He remembered how at the	731.2994
He thought of Aramis who	1663.5957
He was confessing to himself	905.3671

They had traveled onward about	348.3420
Stop sir look yonder he	432.5211
I fancy I hear horses	56.7398
The ground is soaking wet	2046.1229
There are men somewhere about	1953.5035
The obscurity was broken only	524.9376
Here and there a dog	2377.2412
These were the only living	93.9969
Toward the middle of the	1147.3573
DArtagnan looked attentively at the	17.0012

DArtagnan followed but less nimbly	1046.9512
I beg your pardon said	610.0150
Marry forsooth people dont die	531.3372
DArtagnan then looked around attentively	14.3772
Never was there an apartment	134.4566
At each corner were arranged	2897.5657
Exteriorly nothing in the room	86.0504
The hangings were of damask	1270.6842

Bazin quickly covered the table	2384.6299
But you expected some one	28.9543
Oh said Aramis I always	1094.3306
Come no hypocrisy <PAD> <PAD>	8.7114

Each of them when the	108.3281
It was Aramis who broke	18.3723
What are you thinking of	19.9503

Now my dear friend look	819.2051

Unhappily those times are past	23.3522

At all events if you	1043.6346
From eight in the evening	857.4595

Come come sleepy head quick	2190.5322
Didnt you see that Monsieur	37.8488

Bazin uttered a profound sigh	96.9723
Presently a good solid wooden	91.0130
Now then said DArtagnan this	91.8601
A woman could go up	1258.9135
Besides at that moment he	339.7256

Whats the matter asked Aramis	10.5686
Do you not see that	531.6905
DArtagnan took advantage of the	995.7078
At that instant the moon	1075.6670
Aramis returned laughing one hat	475.6519
Good said DArtagnan rising and	1238.2770
Thanks to what Aramis had	890.1211
It was then in the	120.2975
His itinerary was promptly determined	2879.3713
Planchet who was still a	1411.6632
DArtagnan suggested that he should	784.2140
This reasoning seemed to DArtagnan	960.0527
At midnight the two travelers	1437.7113
The next morning DArtagnan summoned	1688.2166
DArtagnan however gathered from his	659.1839
At nine in the morning	93.1641
His host here was a	367.0627
The Bracieux estate was a	59.3310
DArtagnan was acquainted with VillarsCotterets	1350.6427
He therefore shaped his course	270.3635
There he ascertained that the	510.5823
Porthos had in fact been	1183.3810
He now called himself Du	571.6915
The travelers were therefore obliged	1089.2899
It is true they might	774.4979
There was another thing that	929.4667
Accordingly DArtagnan on awaking found	53.0582
It need not be said	1548.3306
It was nearly eight oclock	57.0272
Their course was clearly defined	1555.2328
The morning was beautiful and	1424.3140
In other parts of the	1479.0210
There came up from all	1208.9332
DArtagnan sick of the closeness	1171.2003
At the extremity of the	391.0020
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
oh he said I fancied	175.8812
Can Porthos have negotiated for	1890.5145
One might have fancied that	321.8088
On arriving at the extremity	967.4113
DArtagnan no longer doubted that	119.0469
The road led straight up	1809.5052
DArtagnan spurred his horse on	275.9758
In ten minutes DArtagnan reached	2827.3870
In the midst of this	822.5275
On his right hand and	429.4875
A considerable number of clowns	216.7456
Ah said DArtagnan to himself	276.6326
Welladay <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8481
how he has shrunk since	1177.4540
Monsieur Porthos was six feet	1181.7035
As he approached he seemed	68.6014
Jesu cried Planchet can it	934.2709
It was indeed MousquetonMousqueton as	4000.3608
Monsieur dArtagnan <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.6211
Monsieur dArtagnan cried Mousqueton his	1344.1235

what joy for my lord	573.3718
where is thy master You	638.2662

Hey yes thank God I	60.0379
But hast thou nothing to	220.3762
Planchetart thou there cried Mousqueton	126.6056
My very self replied Planchet	3215.0518
never Planchet <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5049

And now sir resumed Mousqueton	1126.9142
And youfellows resumed Mousqueton stay	2604.0840
Ah there <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.0199
theres something promising said DArtagnan	13.6110
No mysteries no cloak to	5749.1426
I see nothing but faces	2522.1179
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
sir what a cook must	1101.0219
If the reality corresponds with	1327.7148
Wealth does not necessarily produce	30.2933
DArtagnan passed through the iron	99.2730
He alighted as he saw	83.6838
Let us do justice to	13.6838
Independently of every selfish wish	2519.5696
He ran to Porthos and	789.2939
Mousqueton at the head of	26.4608
Porthos linked his arm in	28.5748
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
how delightful to see you	685.4863

On the contrary there is	630.9632
Yes we did some fine	1291.6470
Under any circumstances he resumed	1151.2467
I have four harriers which	1821.8947
But first interposed DArtagnan you	490.8881
I lost Madame du Vallon	754.6461
That was the reason why	923.4788
Poor Madame du Vallon <PAD>	11.0935
her temper was uncertain but	1545.6240
Let us go to breakfast	667.2687
A table ready set out	28.7579
You see said Porthos this	624.9160
The king has nothing like	687.5991
Taste this cutlet my dear	1343.5039
Yes the sheep are fed	3758.5540
what a flavor cried DArtagnan	20.5085
they are fed on thyme	2054.7112
He became curious to solve	30.0418
Well now he said it	276.5403
That health which Excellent my	72.6835

I have happily only myself	1123.5570

Go away now Mouston So	2204.5957
You can suppose Porthos that	1539.0485
They were innumerable <PAD> <PAD>	8.5513
However what had you to	541.6799
hang it said Porthos <PAD>	7.3375
I see you are spoiled	947.7355

As happy as possible and	1200.4957
it depends on you only	633.0375
You sir know how necessary	1974.2324
Well my dear Mouston he	29.9934
I will call thee Mouston	1685.8828

DArtagnan was secretly touched with	1385.9602
He was thinking of these	83.4770
What <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8407
to dinner said DArtagnan <PAD>	8.7846
What time is it then	15.1049

I follow you though I	2332.3752
Meanwhile his misgivings in regard	1309.9202
Therefore when at dessert upon	744.9365

See to these horses <PAD>	8.1486
Polish up or make some	64.6182

Something better still Mouston An	1068.9152
We are going to return	1266.3660
Into the servicethe kings service	2062.8386
Yes and no <PAD> <PAD>	5.6345
We shall serve in a	2429.3213
It was those very terrible	860.3986
The two friends remained alone	280.2984
The good wine which Mousqueton	2229.3630
Mousqueton was however somewhat consoled	1079.1991
Butformerlyit appears began Mousqueton timidly	18.7662
Oh said DArtagnan we dont	90.3598
Today its a sort of	1276.9349
But he added in this	1169.3398
Four days replied his friend	1061.1765
Set out therefore in a	1073.2780
As to myself I shall	753.7330
The friends then took leave	905.1431
At least DArtagnan said to	454.6998
That devil Porthos is a	1111.9269
I am just setting out	26.9248
The Comte de la Fere	876.0624
Two Angelic Faces <PAD> <PAD>	11.3319
The road was long but	1064.4540
He had been raised by	134.7163

Planchet was in truth no	898.7136
Without courting danger he never	1649.6714
Going along DArtagnan shaking his	643.0646
Scattering money round about him	72.9205
Do you remember sir that	184.7637
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
how lofty how magnificent Monsieur	1029.6562
One seemed as he raised	1011.2206
There was no one like	547.6793
This noble gentleman with his	1955.0140
Alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8417
we shall find him changed	1797.6096
God knows Planchet that I	914.3871
It was evident that he	46.7555

We are looking for the	76.1842
The peasant took off his	110.7994
Gentlemen he said the wood	526.6890
The chateau he said to	24.8644
Ah I understand <PAD> <PAD>	6.1857
Athos is not a man	615.5410
He had a heavy handdear	2067.6345
He checked by degrees the	800.3057
Soon as the road turned	1268.4243
On beholding this house DArtagnan	2015.3616
He proceeded nevertheless and came	436.4814
Through the gate was seen	2865.4336
We are mistaken said DArtagnan	10.7668
This can not be the	20.1206
Good heavens <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9732
suppose he is dead and	254.8595
Alight Planchet and inquire for	303.9268
Thou must add said DArtagnan	714.2090
Does Monsieur le Comte de	108.0903
Yes monsieur it is here	214.1668
A nobleman retired from service	1819.0769
Monsieur Grimaud is absent from	591.4127
Then cried Planchet joyously I	669.1183
Be good enough to open	633.4185
But where is your master	1086.4276
The latter his heart palpitating	203.4517
Whilst Planchet was standing on	561.7897
He vaulted hastily from his	1023.1761

At these words a visible	397.7424
He rushed toward DArtagnan with	181.0918
DArtagnan equally moved pressed him	309.8061
Athos then took him by	311.7145
Every one arose <PAD> <PAD>	7.2419
I present to you he	793.1433
Strange <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8516
Athos was scarcely aged at	16.9929
His fine eyes no longer	5572.2227
His face a little elongated	558.9224
His hand always wonderfully beautiful	2290.1616
He was less stiff than	22.3759
His long dark hair softly	5448.7100
Meanwhile the guests seeing that	959.7959
tis Raoul who is come	791.7267
But DArtagnan was still in	1103.7637
Nevertheless DArtagnan was struck by	57.3934
It seemed to explain to	681.6603
He remained listening and gazing	14.9191
Here you are home again	31.5777
Yes sir replied the youth	765.5511
You are pale and agitated	667.0311
What is it cried many	21.9783
She was walking with her	1526.8341
She saw me also and	614.6277
I fear that she has	236.5005

But where is Louise asked	21.9080
I have brought her here	1244.9808
You are right sir said	13.7498
She will be the sooner	21.5186
As for you Raoul I	1160.8289

He again took in his	1649.8767

The Castle of Bragelonne <PAD>	11.3681
Whilst this scene was going	217.2627
Everything had turned out so	241.4957
Athos who had been observing	496.0078
Whilst supper is being prepared	628.1680
Athos smiled <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5870
First and foremost dear DArtagnan	112.5634
When I call you chevalier	378.7966
But to you DArtagnan I	130.8834
Do you intend to stand	425.3737
God forbid Then let us	443.8110
You are surprised at what	1063.2025
Should you not have known	657.0847
Everything DArtagnan even folly has	2260.7019
You have a park and	38.6714
Yes I inherited this little	165.2325
The park is twenty acrestwenty	122.7610
I have two horsesI do	115.6850
My sporting dogs consist of	279.1883
But then all this extravagance	90.7263
Yes I see for the	27.4169
You guess aright my friend	1066.2665
I have brought him up	10.7911
It is Raoul who has	1187.2900
This child has caused me	60.3219
I had no longer any	137.1685
I have corrected the vices	209.8029
Precept something but example more	13.3850
I may be mistaken but	1410.2120
And you are happy he	20.4716
As happy as it is	634.5162
I wished to ask you	332.8078
I finish your phrase <PAD>	12.4747
Yes and no <PAD> <PAD>	5.6345
I do not feel remorse	318.9425
Had she one redeeming trait	19.2596
I doubt it <PAD> <PAD>	6.6372
I do not feel remorse	1229.0438
But I do not mean	105.9303
Perhaps all blood demands some	26.4003
Hers had been accomplished it	1320.4880
I often think of that	36.5055
for I had forgotten him	19.4582
Athos smiled the smile was	15.4016
And Lord de Winterdo you	810.6489
He shed the blood of	381.9554
And the queen What queen	1147.9806
Her daughter during the severest	303.6750
Do you grasp that said	178.4607
shivering for want of a	15.5655
Why did she not ask	165.8072
She should have wanted nothing	198.8540
No but my mother as	27.4559
Did I ever tell you	362.1836
You know Athos you never	1276.6183
Every one according to his	31.2460
Porthos in spite of a	122.5892
Have you seen him I	941.4630
I sometimes wonder replied Athos	1980.0154
Friendship throws out deep roots	77.1525
Believe me it is only	175.4692
And Aramis I have seen	474.0461
Why it is a veritable	1059.5955
Aramis you know continued Athos	920.3958
Athos made no reply <PAD>	9.4836
He is not curious thought	14.6619
Athos not only failed to	101.4602
You see said he calling	707.0059
At this instant they heard	43.2585
Tis Raoul who has come	699.4124
Monsieur said Athos placing his	876.5175
He extended a hand to	638.9429
But he will make it	36.0862
I like your manner Raoul	583.3572
He looked at DArtagnan with	795.1215
Now said DArtagnan to himself	684.0633
Athos led his guest into	1209.9097
DArtagnan glanced at the dinner	16.8821
The plate was magnificent old	54.1250
DArtagnan stopped to look at	224.1060
That workmanship is divine he	20.6704
Yes a chef doeuvre of	347.7120
What battle does it represent	1643.3003
It was on that occasion	1320.6392
Men were giants in those	219.3313
Let us sit down to	17.7879
Call Charles he added addressing	42.2966
My good Charles I particularly	255.2005
He likes good wine now	79.6977
He has slept a long	1245.0082
You think of everything said	820.5718
That name sounds strange to	1722.5737
My friend is still so	1007.7125
You have not forgotten St	1181.0544
DArtagnan does not tell you	643.6920
He was eighteen only three	1673.8356

The absence of Grimaud whose	341.7107

DArtagnan had heard the door	404.2027
At last a nightingale lost	2403.5391
Not a sound was heard	895.7555
He is walking about and	50.5792
It is impossible to know	1110.7483
Silence and fatigue together overcame	106.9311

True to his custom of	597.3813
The young man was opening	33.3557
He then with noiseless haste	1326.9502
The road as DArtagnan had	48.0343
So thought the Gascon heres	1378.2449
Hes not going to hunt	1420.1940
Why does he go in	14.5076
Is he afraid of me	22.6906
for I am sure the	22.6713

You spoke to me Athos	191.6116
But he has wealth I	53.3623
But such is man we	920.3300
I forgot said Athos laughing	14.2901
Tis true thought the Gascon	39.2298
Does he correspond with Aramis	12.9220
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
if I knew that he	334.8485

Hes well guarded now we	1712.9592
My lord said the guard	1229.0596
No replied the soldier tenacious	1424.6414
Well <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8489
the queen has not only	631.9276
Mazarin made a grimace as	1101.8748
After Whitsuntide it would be	463.0440
It has its own effect	603.6570
He went away thoughtful and	1032.7397
The guard had in fact	86.7875
During the whole five years	509.3115
It was not possible as	762.6224
But however and whensoever he	1705.1748
Meantime Mazarin redoubled his surveillance	36.3804
But like the miser in	205.0977
Often he awoke in the	322.3336
Then he inquired about him	1231.5958
So much did this one	879.4745

The officer entered a large	94.6739

Monsieur de Beaufort told the	579.6925

when I leave him I	1202.8198
I promise you he keeps	63.6376
During the three weeks that	568.0919
I thought for a long	167.6114
It seems his former master	1048.1221
It was now nine oclock	12.7470
The cardinal therefore got up	757.5805

Duc de Beaufort amused his	164.4131
The captive who was the	879.2916
He had found himself so	622.0815
His vengeance therefore consisted in	1601.6412
The duke was the grandson	33.0015

After having been for some	83.5836

The intelligent creature was received	48.9204
The first part of the	1028.9283
Nothing could be better done	350.0549
Then the question was put	222.1639
The dog performed three evolutions	1482.8972
Then the duke put to	296.2518
Pistache went again around the	452.1434
See gentlemen said M de	1466.0453
Pistache my friend come here	11.2780
Is not the greatest thief	1364.9994
Then is it not resumed	1027.0759
Can it be can it	2615.1201
Gentlemen you see said the	735.3907
Monsieur de Chavigny be so	1466.9941
Monsieur de Beaufort placed it	94.3539
Now Pistache my good dog	2540.0308
The dog sprang and in	147.5310
And now said the duke	2204.9207
Now then said the duke	1129.6628
What asked the duke what	633.3433
Jump then Monsieur Pistache But	871.4698
Monsieur de Beaufort made the	1980.7755
Monsieur de Beaufort took the	1148.8289
Three days afterward Pistache was	39.3968
Then the duke said openly	958.5468
This fresh impertinence reached the	141.9775
The donjon of Vincennes was	1032.0314
So it was ordered the	946.3888
Every kind of revenge was	957.7834
De Chavigny who according to	985.0863
He took from the duke	2823.0896
A fortnight afterward the duke	1328.3810
One morning the gardener went	479.8147
Now since as every one	2584.0037
At last his patience was	18.5691
He assembled his keepers and	830.6852
will you permit a grandson	37.5465
to be overwhelmed with insults	29.6828
Odds fish <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0710
as my grandfather used to	68.0832
do you know that <PAD>	6.8421
I had the king and	65.9666

Gentlemen and citizens set me	182.4543
You shall be my bodyguard	13.5615

did not touch those hearts	1221.2367
Sometimes when Monsieur de Chavigny	732.7183
My lord answered De Chavigny	1229.7490
I should bombard the troops	2026.9440
For myself on the other	690.9885
These bittersweet pleasantries lasted ten	3859.8323
La Ramee La Ramee came	30.5483
La Ramee I recommend Monsieur	1227.9285
Now although La Ramee appreciated	978.8121
hardly compensated for the loss	592.2211
One may be a jailer	249.8979
La Ramee adored his wife	907.9637
Twas too brief an enjoyment	1036.5846
He accepted therefore with delight	789.5789
We consider it useless to	1622.3433
But Grimaud had for twelve	2935.7686
Chapter XVIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0142
Grimaud begins his Functions <PAD>	12.6197
Grimaud thereupon presented himself with	196.5924
Now Monsieur de Chavigny piqued	1073.6567
He addressed about twelve words	72.0817
Heres a promising fellow and	365.0927
Go he added and make	795.5201
So after a thousand questions	1783.6545
My orders asked Grimaud <PAD>	10.2228
They are these never to	955.6411
All now replied La Ramee	13.4280
Good answered Grimaud and he	33.6397
The duke was in the	782.0459
But having some days previously	1211.0790
The comb was to be	1075.3065
As Grimaud entered he saw	592.7882
The duke looked at this	43.7125
The figure put the comb	35.0937
Ho <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8429
hey <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8455
whats that cried the duke	9.2221
Who is this creature Grimaud	107.3336
Art thou dumb cried the	18.4827
Grimaud made a sign that	16.6416
What art thou then <PAD>	11.5203
Answer <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8458
I command thee said the	16.3350
A keeper replied Grimaud <PAD>	11.0875
A keeper reiterated the duke	421.6800
Halloo <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8501
La Ramee <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5566
some one La Ramee ran	71.3890
Who is this wretch who	342.2142
One of your guards my	527.5330
Grimaud drew the comb from	2482.0750
What does the animal say	24.6162
That the king has forbidden	613.9510
You yourself gave me this	647.9037
I perceive that this creature	118.2776
Grimaud nevertheless was resolved for	1010.9081
A fresh practical joke now	57.2049
He had asked for crawfish	641.0959
The day was employed in	37.0345
Every one grows childish in	925.9384
In the course of his	1226.2701
When he came home he	76.1703
Nothing of all this escaped	602.2740
The guards looked on it	21.7880
When everything was ready the	609.1337
Who has taken my piece	73.6624
Grimaud made a sign to	50.6518
What <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8407
thou again <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.2116
Why didst thou take it	76.2734
Grimaud who held the piece	555.9581
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
deuce take it <PAD> <PAD>	6.2398
we have a precious fellow	793.0386
hush cried La Ramee give	61.5829
I will shape it out	1026.3680
Thats it said the duke	636.7469
Then he placed the gibbet	126.4281
La Ramee laughed also and	423.9821
He approached La Ramee and	438.6077
Hung by order of his	2260.3398
He was going to throw	282.4389
Good to eat he said	36.9928
This scene so enchanted the	766.5172
But the story of the	520.6260
Monsieur de Chavigny who at	1042.9805
The prisoner happened to remark	757.1572
One morning he took this	591.2629
Go away he said <PAD>	7.4496
The guard obeyed <PAD> <PAD>	8.6166
You are insupportable cried the	95.8442
I will break every bone	73.5636
Grimaud bowed but stepped back	14.7828
Mr <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8481
Spy cried the duke more	794.8179
At the same time he	1367.8767
A gesture a smile and	1339.4944
Grimaud took advantage of that	1697.5764
The duke more and more	133.8109
From Madame de Montbazon he	16.5047
Grimaud nodded assent <PAD> <PAD>	9.9618

Wait he continued renewing his	1426.6542

Whereupon Grimaud observing the dukes	1178.7977
Here is what you are	20.5182
The duke opened the purse	590.5022
Thank you monseigneur he said	437.2747
He held out his hand	11.5721
Grimaud drew near and kissed	26.2463
The grand manner of Athos	80.3214
What shall we do <PAD>	8.1101
and when <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.9817
and how proceed It is	53.5925
Let my lord at two	898.1459
Grimaud made a sign that	26.0594
Ah cried the duke will	635.1049
speak Tis this when we	898.0084
At this moment La Ramee	274.5141
The duke had thrown himself	692.9530
La Ramee cast an inquiring	1614.9037
Then turning to Grimaud Very	52.9150
You have been spoken of	664.3970
Well my lord said La	843.6492

Yes continued the duke really	1496.7500
If you wish it I	579.2689
Have you seen him lately	84.1444
to speak to you about	225.9520
Really my lord you are	107.2979
Ah La Ramee <PAD> <PAD>	7.8399
if you would but accept	22.2560
I would make your fortune	17.4787
you would no sooner have	1623.3066
pshaw <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8446
I can not hear such	390.8665
I see my lord I	981.5931
So you and the cardinal	30.7479
La Ramee some day when	667.1151
And what did the cuistre	1927.0076
What did he say to	10.9255
He told me to watch	30.7936
why watch me asked the	23.3093
Because an astrologer had predicted	61.0781
an astrologer predicted that said	101.3789
Oh mon Dieu <PAD> <PAD>	9.9565
yes <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8433
those imbeciles of magicians can	2304.2209
Let us go and have	2472.6189
this man your highness when	1000.0826
I bought said he the	875.4410
Well Monsieur La Ramee you	595.7193
Go then animal said the	973.9840
But during these five minutes	1045.4491
But his confidence in Grimaud	1966.7091
Chapter XIX <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6600
Pts made by the Successor	74.5054
In half an hour La	1800.9360
The pates were excellent the	32.8386
The weather was fine and	198.8688
At two oclock the tennis	1071.5822
La Ramee then proposed to	1004.7559
Hey friend cried the duke	10.4326
The man raised his head	154.4612
The peasant the gardener was	129.0015
Well <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8489
Whos up there said the	11.0075
Be so good as to	185.6253
The gardener nodded and began	1199.2250
One however fell at the	691.9367
La Ramee was in ecstasies	109.0381
The duke went indoors and	1164.2335
La Ramee carried off all	412.7078
However the duke contrived to	983.3944
Ask day after tomorrow to	936.8655
Do not open the pie	33.6912
I hope you will be	38.9291
Your highnesss most devoted servant	2837.0093
La Ramee entered he smiled	848.6008
He endeavored to cheer him	42.2181
Ah my friend cried the	527.7471
Besides I have promised him	95.2808
If I am to remain	1117.0387
Let us then take advantage	186.2297
the day after tomorrow is	1673.0416
Send the guards to take	977.0164
The proposal was seductive but	1968.7030
Monsieur de Beaufort had said	175.5902
Did this proposed breakfast cover	38.1072
He reflected but he remembered	512.8750
As to getting him drunk	672.4336
Then an idea came to	42.3720
The duke had followed with	1589.9170
But presently the exempts face	42.3456
Well he asked that will	685.0932
He will spoil the feast	1485.2268
Are you afraid that the	856.3220
Well then with well acted	600.7831
Order whatever you like for	1174.4362
The devil replied the prince	54.2461
I am fifteen years younger	32.5267
At Vincennes tis true one	3904.4890
He stopped however at the	30.2499
Whom does your highness wish	953.4927
A strange thing is the	802.9734
The duke had been five	794.7102
Besides there was one thing	616.7147
They had told him to	369.5386
And what friends awaited him	16.8840
He had friends then after	36.1995
If that were so he	62.7150
He forgot that besides his	431.3866
It is true that she	654.5174
So the duke had more	1431.1941
But his successive defeats did	1252.9427
So at least the duke	1585.2190
The duke waited until midnight	632.6699
Finally he slept <PAD> <PAD>	6.9662
But at daybreak he awoke	13.7906
Wild dreams had disturbed his	21.8193
He dreamed that he was	124.3014
For a time these wings	882.9832
His wings were broken and	2544.6375
He fell asleep again and	40.4786
He was in a subterranean	78.7711
Grimaud was walking before him	24.8906
By degrees the passage narrowed	88.4415
At last it became so	180.4769
The sides of the walls	149.3517
He made fruitless efforts to	52.8772
Nevertheless he still saw Grimaud	70.7467
He wished to call out	80.5848
Then at the other extremity	146.6893
These steps came on came	19.8975
He was discovered all hope	36.8374

Athos bowed and obeyed <PAD>	9.6283
The footman was withdrawing but	70.6570
Madame he said to the	509.8797

Oh I am very presuming	30.5208
The interview for which I	518.9137
You may go The footman	25.6129

There is a popular proverb	1707.6045
That cousin of Aramis that	3005.0886

Her face as she looked	252.7343
It could be seen that	720.1621
What happened then she asked	12.1023

Well monsieur le comte said	2344.5071
Chapter XXI <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6873
The Abb Scarron <PAD> <PAD>	8.9461
There was once in the	1271.2883
There was neither dining nor	231.8586
Nevertheless it was the rendezvous	82.7116
It was the abode of	31.6640
In the home of the	1249.1230
The diminutive Abb Scarron who	1543.4514
On a day of the	1102.7115
He had made his valet	984.8182
He then began to visit	162.3908
At first he had been	1582.8291
As soon as he took	1371.7513
Scarron was heated the cold	710.7440
Every means had been employed	149.2243
He had been subjected to	2105.5928
There he had a chair	839.9578
Yes your majesty there is	127.5145
And what is that That	69.9873
So he was called the	163.0284
From that lucky moment Scarron	374.3556
One day however an emissary	773.4808
And why asked Scarron is	3108.7646
Impossible The conversation had rested	1723.5408
Now the very morning of	705.1484
It was on Thursday the	196.5407
The cardinals refusal to pay	1123.9974
In the Rue Saint Honore	1050.8900
One of them hat in	102.7041

And they separated with courteous	26.4185
It happens well that we	825.2496
Is he some minister out	767.9930
Nevertheless he continued in the	625.9527
Consider well what you do	18.1718
Talk only by gestures or	137.0352
You will see me talking	626.8858
That little stratagem may serve	2355.4832
Athos forced his way through	65.4157
The first person that struck	1667.8300
This was the Abb Scarron	1336.8724
Around this kind of rolling	145.1979
The room was neatly comfortably	28.5564
Large valances of silk embroidered	4099.9746
Two well trained servingmen were	76.7944
On perceiving Athos Aramis advanced	292.2215
Raoul remained silent for he	189.7891
After some minutes the door	103.1972
Athos touched the shoulder of	18.7164
Look at this lady Raoul	776.9570

She was a tall woman	1594.3141

Mademoiselle Paulet has observed you	1031.4208

Scarron turned around toward him	84.4517
Well said the coadjutor on	448.8713
It had been said that	1230.5967
Monsieur the Cardinal Mazarin has	96.1912
But how can you continue	934.6390
At this moment the door	68.1856
Every one arose <PAD> <PAD>	7.2419
Scarron turned his chair toward	930.5394
In the midst of all	618.4442
Apropos she said as if	1082.2054

Why he is surrounded by	48.3204
Madame de Saintot has hastened	4086.9397
What an injustice my dear	21.7977

Meantime Aramis had drawn near	1186.7964
Aramis notwithstanding his selfcontrol could	176.1385
Laugh then said Monsieur de	863.5190

As she uttered that bon	147.9678
Mademoiselle Paulet had already gone	75.7710
Vicomte said Athos to Raoul	533.4432
You are going already he	12.7369
One of the last as	532.8542
Certainly his panegyric has been	2059.4873
One by one the several	33.0126
Scarron seemed not to observe	1017.6550
What was all that to	12.1254
At his house rebellion could	981.2847
The carriage had started Madame	769.5760
Athos surmised what had taken	33.2811
Come vicomte he said it	299.6616
Sleep well your last night	250.0248
Oh monsieur I thank you	1001.5830
Scarron followed their movements with	94.9132
Not one of them will	668.1918
Who knows if they will	112.3971
They can move their arms	53.1805
Alas I have only my	243.7303

In the first place he	1462.3518
Then he placed at the	924.9667
At length after occupying about	757.7612
The sun already high penetrated	1233.4182
He was still sleeping his	94.2791
Athos approached and hung over	1121.3448
By degrees Athos gave himself	1193.7035
His own youth seemed to	2115.7095
Between the past and the	46.8945
But imagination has the wings	1534.9363
He remembered that all the	657.5615
In recalling all he had	655.8261
At this moment Raoul awoke	1756.0468
You are there sir he	18.1823
Yes Raoul replied the count	9.9191
And you did not awaken	714.2921
How do you feel this	23.8953
Perfectly well quite rested sir	1931.6774
Oh sir I beg your	1102.8630
Everything said Olivain to Athos	847.8109
Truly sir you overwhelm me	913.7359
Oh sir <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.0754
God knows how much I	1236.5936
No indeed sir answered Raoul	13.8081
The servant then approached Athos	1467.1621
When they reached the steps	39.0941
Oh sir <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.0754
then you are going with	143.5065
Joy shone in Raouls eyes	111.9368
Athos mounted more slowly after	1060.0411
Raoul delighted at the counts	347.0372
They set out passing over	3171.7217
They proceeded to the Rue	24.4385
After passing through the Porte	1659.7837
I have already often told	456.7046
See <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8465
your horse is tired already	1127.1394
You hold the bit too	918.1349
The safety of a cavalier	199.7634
In a week remember you	1692.4683
I have remarked also another	1153.7185
This tension lessens the accuracy	47.9849
So in twelve times you	1185.9546
Because I bent my arm	708.3448

At all events should you	875.1042
We are judges of wounds	95.0349
Thank you sir answered the	30.2714
They arrived that very moment	167.6347
Here comes a young gentleman	658.4673
By his manner sir and	926.4039
Faith yes with a haughty	999.3671
Alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8417

Olivain take care of our	498.5982

A love as tender as	1876.8108
Athos said a word to	197.7688
Come Raoul he said let	1437.8470

Then Athos raised his hand	801.4636
He whose intellect was thus	1583.8922
Remember Raoul this <PAD> <PAD>	6.6020
If Richelieu made the king	172.8088

The minister so feared so	1267.0298
So blind were his contemporaries	1382.3473
Raoul learn how to distinguish	772.0746
Whenever you hesitate as to	1460.9913

It will be happier I	55.1525
Different in your fate from	602.9904

Yours is a noble nature	337.3163
It was worn by my	40.3413

Should your hand still be	255.4262
You will have the more	659.7631

Adieu faltered the count who	439.9075
for ever and ever cried	29.8397
I swear to you sir	862.9362
Olivain said Athos showing the	1038.7854

to men who had risked	1278.5111
that little man in black	1181.0359
Unfortunately I didnt crush him	23.7090

Aramis you think that DArtagnan	1149.7896
What can you expect Athos	11.6682
Men are so made and	65.1332
We have cruelly wounded as	454.1936
He has been beaten <PAD>	10.3289
Did you not observe his	30.3367

Go in whatever guise you	850.2003
Tis not one man not	955.6192
And they pursued their road	37.4957
Scarcely had they reached by	1275.1594
They were waiting at the	888.0048
Athos therefore commanded Bazin to	281.3649
They then advanced two and	76.6330
Now where will it be	1053.2885
The gate is shut said	1594.1362
Porthos ventured to put his	592.7712
If you prefer any other	1930.6782
Aramis went off at once	1066.0535
Aramis returned soon with a	688.9066
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
you will not swear my	75.5044
Well one can never say	1288.0023
DArtagnan had heard the conversation	24.4363
You see he said to	10.5392
What do I see That	1280.1277
Aramis opened the gate and	177.8176
In passing through the gate	664.4763
Do you see whispered Aramis	574.4897
Alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8417

The Place Royale <PAD> <PAD>	9.7064
They proceeded silently to the	856.1979
There were benches here and	835.2692
After a few minutes of	47.3142
Gentlemen he said our presence	784.9072
If so speak out answered	16.1197
I have replied DArtagnan <PAD>	7.8061
When I saw you at	789.1656
You asked for candor and	20.7928
You ask what I have	29.1961
And I have the same	711.8646
You came seeking me to	174.7791
No you sounded me nothing	15.2766
Very well what did I	17.7437
that Mazarin was contemptible and	54.4293
But that is all <PAD>	6.8797
Did I tell you that	43.1181
On the contrary I gave	130.2496
We even joked very pleasantly	2193.3657
Were you a party man	9.9534
There is no doubt of	11.4356
Well why should not we	45.7061
You had your secret and	96.0886
So much the better it	852.5614
The blood mounted instantly to	1142.6667
Upon hearing DArtagnans reply Aramis	306.2566
DArtagnan he said you are	119.0963
I believed your heart noble	1459.8041
Come do you really think	55.9263
Say it then if I	1315.7998
He answered therefore I think	963.4302
At that time I was	555.5241
However because I was prudent	81.0883
If I had wished to	1764.0356
I never meddle save with	1053.6954
He said yes and he	39.8132
Aramis started back and drew	15.0652
DArtagnan bent forward ready either	177.4554
Athos at that moment extended	1056.9417
Then turning to Aramis Aramis	87.5154
It must be done said	200.0246
I wish it Then Aramis	2255.6475
These proceedings made DArtagnan and	34.0852
DArtagnan did not draw his	113.2218
Never exclaimed Athos raising his	52.3458
I swear before God who	1190.9529
We lived together we loved	2953.7207
DArtagnan I have always loved	1077.6250
What can Cardinal Mazarin be	780.1542
What is such or such	414.4579
DArtagnan I ask your pardon	976.6479
I repeat my words Aramis	899.2589
I swear he said with	1048.9020
I regret that I ever	868.1198
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484

My son exclaimed Athos pressing	37.4363
And as for me said	84.5745
Forsooth <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8451
If I were obliged to	669.4139
My friends said Athos this	130.1543
Yes I have said it	2240.3608
I respect your convictions and	405.1588
Ministers princes kings will pass	4547.3521
Cardinalists or Frondeurs what matters	18.7298
Let us meet again as	3135.1497
And are the first of	19.5906

Ah Im ready to do	202.1501
Devil take me if Ive	957.3172

Aramis smiled and drew from	1082.9468
Here is one he said	8.1167
Well resumed Athos swear on	1248.6389
Does this oath satisfy you	91.0770
Ah traitor muttered DArtagnan leaning	1365.5201
The Ferry across the Oise	19.0288
We hope that the reader	772.8190
In losing sight of his	1913.5455
One hours rapid progress however	2949.7908
Nevertheless after several attempts at	2216.9739
Another recollection contributed also to	3905.9265
The aspect of external objects	2188.0173
Now the sight of this	1425.9829
With a full heart and	998.0298
As for himself he dismounted	2259.2686
Olivain obeyed and continued on	960.5825
Raoul had been there about	787.6648
Ha <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8470
ha laughed the apparition every	878.0737
The host his mind at	565.9462
By a lucky chance the	178.8102
The host remained standing in	1929.2159
Beauty has always been and	37.6889
Hes not a guest like	1121.3240
he lost it the day	1432.1539
I was so bewildered by	834.7787
You will forgive me sir	641.3846
I entreat you to write	531.1545
It seemed to me as	840.8892
I have therefore as you	61.3945

Will you have the goodness	940.5287
You can understand honored and	826.2288

During this time Olivain had	494.9616
Raoul motioned to the host	1021.5197
The rest that had been	1261.6959
At Verberie Raoul desired Olivain	1411.5057
Let us try and overtake	780.7183
He had stopped like Raoul	853.0417
Well let us sleep at	33.4154
Sir replied Olivain respectfully allow	565.0095
I think it would be	236.1671
Eighteen leagues is enough for	1265.3204
We shall arrive at eight	19.2920
The horses will have a	913.9207
Go on go on said	1785.5037
There you must rest young	1083.4158
Raoul really felt tired but	841.2008
DArtagnan that man of iron	615.7095
Therefore in spite of Olivains	1783.4028
A little troop of men	547.7124
Raoul did not doubt this	541.6165
Raoul seeing that he could	1040.9974
At this moment a shriek	111.3579
Raoul turned toward the side	1248.0651
Olivain he exclaimed what do	874.3188
Oh sir cried Olivain the	493.2511
But what do I see	1050.4822
It was true and Raoul	630.6705
Ah sir cried Olivain what	27.7255
Good God Raoul was directing	129.3863
This was in fact a	30.8538
Having been brought up on	743.0002
Athos foreseeing the period when	1306.5217
Oh heavens continued Olivain in	790.2388
But Ibut I cried Olivain	3268.5791
we are coming to your	1296.2140

A man with gray hair	1239.6967
Raoul continued his way and	960.7263
The nostrils of the horse	1231.9888
One moment longer and all	21.5498
Courage cried Raoul courage Too	2093.6069
Raoul sprang from his horse	911.9448
Raoul at the same time	598.7266
Thus sure that the rider	841.9368
All at once the horse	419.9769
Saved exclaimed the man with	80.0677
Saved mechanically repeated the young	2361.4231
A moment later the grayheaded	44.7734
Olivain managed in his turn	1539.5278
Thanks to the attentions of	506.4036
Ah sir he exclaimed it	13.6031
Without you I was a	873.7187

Doubtless too the horses on	1524.8217
The Count de Guiche was	823.1011
They breakfasted in haste and	192.5199
The young counts conversation was	998.6987
Brought up in Paris where	740.0269
Raoul had only been at	472.9077
Guiche knew everybodyMadame de Neuillan	965.6254
He criticised everybody humorously <PAD>	18.1212
Raoul trembled lest he should	2441.0400
His praises increased Raouls friendship	42.2297
Then came the question of	39.3833
Under this head also Bragelonne	97.9271
He listened attentively and fancied	1448.8436
De Guiche as we have	552.6996
It was the same court	839.6199
The young count witty and	1429.4427
The day passed away as	38.6115
The counts tutor a man	995.5839
The horses which were more	1226.1982
They were approaching the scene	1311.8022
The French army held all	689.7629

The enemys army extended from	2478.1333

An approaching battle was much	1733.4883
The young men congratulated themselves	89.6125
The evening was employed in	1508.1345
In the morning it was	2351.6875
But as there was nothing	2095.1667
The counts tutor was well	1298.0571
They obtained information at Ablain	269.1315
About seven oclock in the	33.4653

Therefore leaving directions at every	1360.6818
The country was beautiful intersected	157.9772
Here and there they passed	179.6580
In anticipation of some ambuscade	1097.0714
Himself and the two young	878.4656
They had observed for some	843.6765
The servants had just disappeared	923.5903

There may be an ambuscade	359.3379

We have fallen in with	31.9515
Come back sirs back The	1528.0972
Another glance between the young	833.3290
Whilst they spurred their steeds	127.6853
In five minutes they arrived	1620.8470
Hush whispered De Guiche these	1648.4156
They are soldiers though resumed	32.1434
Yes skirmishers that is to	141.1722

But he was not listened	265.6386
The men on horseback at	937.9406
De Guiche fired the first	1088.8854
He let off his fire	39.4190
Struck in the breast and	1035.8369
Raoul at this moment perceived	706.1363
His horse bounded to one	1368.4397
The Spaniard sprang forward and	1142.5964
In the position in which	1371.2570
The butt end of the	1511.0520

Without your aid continued he	2158.1008
But are you seriously wounded	13.0705
I see you are covered	644.5889
If you will help me	1786.7557
At last Raoul succeeded in	868.4792
Nothing broken asked De Guiche	16.6309
Faith no thank Heaven replied	1874.3522
They have killed them I	169.8332

The two young men galloped	390.1327
Raoul without dismounting called to	560.6460
He desired him also should	992.1385
The host who saw two	3519.6528
They had gone rather more	1089.4630
Chance for once seemed to	257.2114

In the first place he	1107.7810
Nor was it from caprice	789.3699
If you be a priest	512.5922
He is some Spanish or	234.7715
A glance threatening and transient	70.9336
Well sir said De Guiche	240.7021
Then father said Raoul forcing	970.8356

In the space of five	367.1920

Horrible replied Raoul especially in	1674.2546
I confess I am accustomed	1192.7329

Absolution comes not from him	62.6638
However for my part I	437.6402
You are of my opinion	26.0409

Monsieur dArminges was already mounted	15.5635
Olivain had ready the horses	672.1559
As a further precaution they	42.2055

Alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8417

Is it as hopeless as	32.8537
madame more hopeless than he	20.3828
His majesty has so good	849.0768
England is torn in twain	3468.1638

Montrose beaten at Philiphaugh was	987.1783

At the very moment when	604.9156
Although the cardinal was often	692.2826
The true difficulty of being	535.2142
It was therefore at the	2384.8665
The young man having left	669.0906

The cavalier entered the second	181.6924
Have you a letter of	131.4693

Whether he only held his	1162.2932
You seek me sir said	13.1673
From whom may the letter	878.3190
Be so good as to	860.8065
Bernouin cast an inquisitorial glance	537.7883
A man bringing a letter	59.3445
And what kind of a	80.9358

The young man appeared on	601.0662
Mazarin rose <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4740
Have you sir asked he	327.7376
Mazarin took the letter and	34.3189
Mordaunt one of my secretaries	850.5117
He is also the bearer	120.3571
Oliver Cromwell Very well Monsieur	1350.8707
The cardinal however did not	693.6195
I am older than your	122.6338
Years of suffering in my	883.8176
You are poor are you	1842.2036
If I bore my proper	63.9492
If I bore my name	720.8506
My name is Mordaunt replied	32.4559
Mazarin now understood that Cromwells	131.1780
He was silent for an	721.5976
The messenger was unmoved <PAD>	11.9427
Devil take these Puritans said	2422.5288
Three times I presented myself	972.1869
my dear Mr Mordaunt said	1441.1562
You know not then anything	1151.8408
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
yes my lord said the	1359.7134
And who brought you up	21.9424
A French nurse who sent	1230.4012
I now understand why you	596.2501
Mazarin marked with surprise the	214.0590
Just as ordinarily faces are	933.2949
Your history is a terrible	2349.8020
Thanks my lord I will	24.7187
He will treat me better	536.3719
The young mans eyes gradually	950.7840
After reading the first lines	623.3984
Observing his indifference he shrugged	1183.3059
Let us see what this	4440.1997
The two kingdoms are so	1027.7524
The English are almost of	413.5561
Placed by popular confidence at	1401.4279
I am at present in	956.2113
I shall gain it for	267.0170
This battle won by me	898.5739
France has already received Queen	2935.6831
But Madame Henrietta is a	203.1450
As to King Charles the	2117.0244
The latter continued in thought	12.0487
Mazarin resumed his reading It	806.9838
The interests of that kingdom	919.3300
England needs tranquillity at home	3301.0266
You need as much as	1091.3374
Your quarrels with the parliament	1650.7715
I have therefore believed monseigneur	1167.5916
That neutrality consists simply in	4935.0352
My letter is private and	522.9813
It anticipates through a sentiment	634.6115
Oliver Cromwell considered it more	1550.8701
Farewell monseigneur should I not	843.9919
Oliver Cromwell Mr <PAD> <PAD>	8.9211
Mordaunt said the cardinal raising	665.8042
That is not all sir	992.8390
Sir said the cardinal you	16.4686

Henrietta Maria and Mazarin <PAD>	9.9859
The cardinal rose and advanced	96.1439
He showed the more respect	1401.4760
But supplicants for favor know	810.7756
smiled as she advanced to	82.9641
Ah said Mazarin to himself	785.2258
Your eminence said the august	676.1817
I am here to petition	1324.0826
Your eminence it concerns the	711.4211
You are perhaps ignorant that	787.8481
In case of a check	1089.7705
What do you say to	1397.0896
How will the crown which	2120.6758
A daughter of Henry IV	1850.6321
Nevertheless you ought to remember	1009.9320
Ere the cardinal your predecessor	1692.2012
If anything yet remains of	967.3094
That admiration is on the	1260.4078

And yet he but desired	373.3783
Mazarin pretended not to understand	1695.5702
Well then your eminence said	963.1887
Absent kings are very soon	1461.6449
If I had had a	944.4039
On the day when foreign	948.2816
If he comes to France	49.7788
What do you intend to	12.5700
Speak Madame said the cardinal	1907.5092
After which your majesty will	1200.0208
Well what do you propose	592.3573
You will charge Broussel to	22.9091
Enough sir enough <PAD> <PAD>	7.2762
I understand you or rather	25.5449
Go to the parliament for	340.5369
Poor queen already fallen <PAD>	11.0772
Though all bowed before her	1044.5337
It signifies little said Mazarin	36.0092
It gave me pain and	588.5951
Bernouin Bernouin entered <PAD> <PAD>	8.2284
See if the young man	468.9976
Your eminence said Comminges as	567.7304
He reflected for a second	42.2028
I believe I saw him	157.0388
But is not your eminence	1071.9736
In crossing the gallery parallel	1393.7388
At this sight the young	1135.5215
His eyes dilated and a	60.7539
One would have said that	690.5695
But he stopped doubtless to	1096.0352
He had not long to	576.2838
At last the heavy machine	1597.0959

How sometimes the Unhappy mistake	53.7186
Well madame said De Winter	105.6449
Well my lord what I	62.3664
does the cardinal refuse to	22.0097
France refuse hospitality to an	28.8116
Ay but it is for	310.3160
Are you not aware that	161.6238
And moreover I should not	130.3219
He was embarrassed whilst speaking	301.3380
Then did you not observe	527.1834
Can they have received any	110.1910
I made such haste that	112.3704
I set out three days	2651.3391
Besides the king I am	1401.3209
I shall go and die	1482.2843
Oh God exclaimed the poor	1240.9843
It is twenty years since	622.1201
I know not whether he	503.8404

As for the two others	656.9403
Listen madame and recall your	19.6447
Have you never heard that	1530.3737
Seek them my lord and	803.3392
Has your majesty forgotten that	1296.2554
At this moment the door	475.9897
But that act of selfcontrol	315.6369
She stopped on the threshold	1070.9110
The queen smiled but instead	1393.1128
My mother replied the young	873.2714
I saw him from the	730.0649
Advancing a few steps toward	48.4626
Madame said he I bear	467.7968
You told me that the	173.0480

It is my fault madame	19.4842
I did announce myself in	851.6370
Yes madame said the young	11.5545
At this announcement of a	978.0194

Yes the Marechal de Grammont	952.3362
This is recent news sir	754.1953

I once knew a Bragelonneis	664.2390
De Winter made a gesture	264.3083
The Comte de la Fere	25.0789
Have you not mentioned that	845.3537
The Comte de la Fere	45.6279
Oh sir reply I entreat	1371.7239
Latterly I heard his friend	315.4378

Providence has declared for us	404.5264

Take them and if you	244.3521

De Winter dismounted at his	965.7848

There was a moment of	48.8353
Sir said De Winter I	1023.9375
I am not your uncle	1003.8671
As for denying that I	863.3658
Oh it concerns you very	722.3608
When I presented myself before	406.2209
Your mother he said <PAD>	7.4756
Yes my lord my mother	611.2957

And the headsman of Bethune	1056.4740
Yes continued the young man	202.1594
My mother inherited an estate	1821.0886
I am no longer astonished	38.0427
I am not surprised that	41.2705
When a man is a	772.7465

You desire to fathom this	243.5953
Know then what manner of	172.8837

I have proof of it	9.7656
What say you to that	616.2781
What say you to that	554.5853
Will this crime persuade you	608.7745
At last charged with murders	3569.2471
Depraved as a girl adulterous	2718.3547
she was my mother <PAD>	7.6609
Her crimes I know them	385.4265
But this I know that	1419.2766

The latter put his hand	430.6350
Then I shall recognize you	583.3889

Athos was happyhappy as he	32.7040
And you assisted and took	253.5931
Yes sir And it was	1396.0867
I did not lose sight	40.1389
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484

Yes sir replied the young	741.9852
Yes sir at that instant	1399.1697
Those who were not killed	54.3213

At that moment I encountered	31.9216
I had but one thought	50.2049
I spurred on and found	881.9186
Go said he the enemy	585.6772
Go and see those whom	672.9949
And now Raoul said he	904.2833
Then when he raised it	381.9798
Lord de Winter exclaimed the	13.8722
Athos my friend And the	924.3692

Monsieur dArtagnan sides with Mazarin	14.5909
Pardon my frankness dear friend	14.0500
I neither hate nor blame	563.6850
But do you happen to	441.5074

Because that young man so	1136.8478

We still remain four friends	993.0743
No said Athos Monsieur Aramis	972.5170

Maillard began the curate this	556.5709

The Tower of St Jacques	63.9867
At a quarter to six	634.4172
At six oclock the curate	71.5805
The coadjutor glanced rapidly behind	140.3920
The curate then entered followed	26.4200

The vicar himself awaited him	846.3084
Although the key was in	31.7102
Come in said a voice	427.5286
He rose on the entrance	126.4008
Well said Gondy have you	202.5819

Singular man muttered Gondy taking	1021.7739
His first idea was that	617.9019
Your blessing your holiness before	91.2774
Your holiness said Gondy my	867.1236
And you want my blessing	17.8728
Yes I have need of	1387.4606

The Riot <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.4859
It was about eleven oclock	22.0407
Gondy had not walked a	699.0403
The whole city seemed peopled	6176.1348
These active beings flitted here	2999.1565
Gondy gazed on these deeds	1490.7839
He felt almost inclined to	339.9232
He reached the Rue Saint	1671.1240
These men were shopkeepers who	160.7120
One individual went from door	1916.4803
By the light of a	40.7933
The coadjutor proceeded onward to	1831.1677
They were standing motionless while	164.0099
All these cloaks gray or	1030.7743
On reaching the Pont Neuf	353.9978
Who are you asked the	10.1849
I do not know you	370.0948
Louvieres recognized him and bowed	11.4680
Gondy continued his way and	121.2064
There he saw a lengthy	124.5418
They might be said to	426.5440
When they reached a certain	819.8702
Gondy edged into a corner	269.2718
The last raised his eyes	985.4547
He walked straight up to	98.7701
Halloo <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8501
Monsieur de Rochefort said Gondy	553.1665
Ah it is you my	15.0424
The very same <PAD> <PAD>	6.8856
What people are you leading	1727.9557
It was now one oclock	69.0182
He opened a window and	35.3805
A strange incomprehensible unearthly sound	2650.5137
From time to time a	756.0176
The work of revolt continued	44.1832
The next morning on awaking	215.6080
It was like a besieged	18.0070
Armed men shouldering muskets watched	6885.8574
Those bearing plumed hats and	3701.9736
They had not yet begun	714.8723
The barricades had been pushed	80.8524
From the Rue de Bons	1371.0752
Among these thousands moved in	3271.2766
The astonishment of Mazarin and	482.8180
Then a window was opened	98.7223
Mazarin shrugged his shoulders and	1831.4751
As for the queen furious	1093.9674
The marshal was ordinarily very	1187.0342
He took a hundred and	965.5274
The marshal made no attempt	189.2877
But at Pont Neuf he	70.5344
This time the marshal charged	2191.1089
He left there three men	12.4394
He beat a retreat toward	1986.7207
He attempted to ride over	2117.0215
The marshal then entered the	1080.7058
They were guarded not only	172.2147
Master Friquet the owner of	754.3003
The marshal thought this barrier	544.5004
He dismounted twenty men to	1132.2455
The twenty men marched straight	1895.5984
The Marechal de la Meilleraie	1431.2726
He returned blow for blow	221.8277
The guards more skillful did	2726.7607
Men fell around him as	150.7457
Fontrailles his aidedecamp had an	931.0947
In short he had reached	1143.7570
All fell to their knees	12.4105
The marshal recognized him and	37.1878
Get me out of this	549.7394
Gondy raised his hand and	22.0436
All were still <PAD> <PAD>	6.5588
My children he said this	803.1906
You pledge yourself to that	150.9719
Morbleu cried the latter I	90.5865
I had no hope of	473.3648
The marshal raised his hand	47.9440
Long live the coadjutor cried	19.1458
Some voices even added Long	2551.7651
It was almost a triumphal	272.5514
The marshal bit his fingers	16.9954
In the meantime as we	241.5041
He called for DArtagnan but	562.2263
In about ten minutes DArtagnan	141.1329
Ah come in come in	153.5676
But what is going on	150.1703
nothing good replied DArtagnan shaking	21.4873
The town is in open	1267.1632
And you did cry he	13.1042
Ifaith no said DArtagnan I	494.9911
Then my lord Then what	20.8616
Look at my hat and	1296.0082
As for Porthoss coat a	1365.8497
Diavolo said the cardinal pensively	979.4559
Mazarin wiped his forehead and	29.2682
He had a great desire	78.6610
See what is going on	23.8070
DArtagnan went to the window	35.3040
Oho said he what is	10.2178
Marechal de la Meilleraie returning	2608.1812

In spite of this recommendation	1731.0919
The balls might be heard	1840.0370
Alack <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8476

The Riot becomes a Revolution	20.1950

The Chancellor Sequier who twenty	3658.7502
Then the danger was so	1868.6809
Fortunately however he had not	822.4722
Then disguised in the clothes	1172.7131
During the recital Mazarin entered	151.9115
Well said the queen when	531.4211
It is not a question	246.8378
Release Broussel she cried never	1168.4347
Ah there you are marechal	64.8779

It is he who has	669.5585
It is true she said	1155.6643
I persist then madame in	1079.6619
Mazarin bowed <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5889
Monsieur le marechal said the	789.7690
DArtagnan turned to Porthos <PAD>	7.9597
How will this end he	11.6029
We shall soon see said	46.0477
In the meantime Anne of	1956.9027
Ere long the door opened	82.4225
There madame he said is	1565.8328
Gondy bowed respectfully <PAD> <PAD>	8.7983
Well sir said the queen	772.6930

Your majesty wishes then You	351.2291
The coadjutor looked at the	96.4132
Were I in her majestys	1242.6938
I believe that not a	204.1884
It was not your opinion	204.7880
If it is I whom	749.3705
Mazarin himself who was well	338.6002
Give up Broussel she cried	41.6660
Upon my word <PAD> <PAD>	6.4960
one can easily see it	1170.3707
He looked coldly at the	323.5953
Mazarin according to his custom	63.4996
Ho <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8429
ho said he good advice	29.3643
I too would give up	960.0215
It was only a way	15.7252
You know I am not	1267.6522
There and elsewhere The coadjutor	1152.2083
I know too well the	449.5520

Who knows said Gondy such	2145.2012
Porthos murmured DArtagnan look well	111.1914
What then Well he is	69.5919
Evidently he did not understand	18.0229
Your majesty continued the coadjutor	1094.9220
If you have it use	22.7468
Peste said DArtagnan to Porthos	8.8377
There is a man after	21.1713
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
if he were minister and	389.2350
what fine things we would	50.6587
The queen made a sign	795.7021
Stay sir said Anne to	12.6101
Good thought Gondy she is	642.4973
I swear to Heaven on	700.1385
Good muttered Mazarin sitting down	2097.5710
It was evident that she	3180.7454
Gondy who began to feel	1464.6240
And now at last said	1120.9932
Am I or am I	15.5361
This screaming mob are they	77.2554
Have I friends <PAD> <PAD>	6.1303
Have I guards <PAD> <PAD>	6.6519
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
by Notre Dame <PAD> <PAD>	9.6956
as Queen Catherine used to	2233.1433
The coadjutor remained immovable and	1278.7921
He were a dead man	676.6262
You a queen to quarrel	29.4276
And do you not perceive	447.8434
Come then on another occasion	1085.0164
When Mazarin ceased speaking he	899.9452
This rough appeal marked by	1808.2753
The queen on her part	2451.2834
A woman and consequently subject	1035.8552
Your majesty has none but	68.8925
It is not the queen	620.4122
how much you have need	82.8383
And what will he promise	20.7590
Peste if he is giving	1028.5133

Gondy smiled the queens color	112.4508
What is that again he	11.4624
At this moment Comminges rushed	27.4032
Pardon your majesty he cried	741.0800
The moaning of waves the	1188.5339
What are my commands said	16.2932
Yes for time presses How	1870.7065
Comminges went out with a	38.6941
At this moment a monstrous	35.8528
One of the gates began	18.6524
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
madame cried Mazarin you have	1021.2415
It is too late said	483.4315
Hoarse shouts were heard from	37.7142
DArtagnan put his hand to	123.7479
Save the queen cried Mazarin	18.6797
Gondy sprang to the window	619.0325
Not a step further he	326.0201
The truth madame said Mazarin	1105.3591
The people kept back by	2752.3750
The queen had written The	1521.0557
The coadjutor whose eyes devoured	1978.3422
This is the order he	9.8747
All Paris seemed to shout	1738.4631
And now that you have	1011.1256
Leave me she exclaimed you	94.3487
It is you who are	33.3928
Then after a moment of	577.5716
He knit his brows and	224.2900
The closet was empty <PAD>	11.0977
At the queens last word	90.7961
Thither Mazarin went in his	134.1189
Why did you leave the	56.6520
Because replied DArtagnan the queen	539.7573
Mazarin saw the sign and	704.5444
Decidedly Monsieur dArtagnan you are	43.0223

Anne of Austria returned to	33.7814

The people had made no	899.9151
During this time Mazarin walked	1692.9276
Ah he said it is	286.3897

What matters it about Brousselit	1099.1912
The next morning therefore when	1273.9512
The latter seemed to be	1069.3174
The coadjutor returned to parliament	309.0950
By his advice a decree	1108.6249
They now knew that it	931.1826
Rochefort had returned to the	554.9686
But the chevalier was himself	232.4212
The mendicant had gone to	1275.0153
No one could suspect that	1222.1204
Louvieres was proud and satisfied	890.7296
His name had been mentioned	127.8663
Laughingly he said to the	565.1755
Raoul had offered some opposition	1454.5288
Rochefort alone was dissatisfied with	41.1782
He had written to the	427.4827
He went to the coadjutor	506.4461
My dear count we have	673.5369

Creatures of the people armed	65.9183

Your doors are guarded the	855.2292

It had been DArtagnans practice	1135.4175

Friend Porthos said DArtagnan handing	600.3500
Read for yourself and judge	843.4532
It is evident by their	157.2098
Just reflect a little what	822.7828
Sharpen your sword baron load	1054.6313
If it is a snare	141.0730
If Mazarin is an Italian	212.8861
Whilst Porthos still in bed	594.5603
Come in exclaimed DArtagnan and	24.6331
From His Eminence Cardinal Mazarin	53.7173
DArtagnan looked at Porthos <PAD>	8.4079
A complicated affair said Porthos	2019.0051
Remember that the queen awaits	472.3947
The servant conducted him by	1731.5443
A certain emotion for which	916.9628
Formerly he would have approached	449.0689
The silence of the oratory	1051.4017
The queen entered <PAD> <PAD>	7.1571
It is you Monsieur dArtagnan	703.2250
Look at me well in	15.9952

All that you tell me	569.7339

The queen reflected for a	1108.4991

Planchet stopped short staring at	20.6525
The first row seeing their	458.4700

On the contrary observed DArtagnan	1194.1345
I did think of it	391.4625
And he began to wander	1091.9235
As to DArtagnan he remained	637.6302

Wait a moment sir said	493.6341

We will divide our regiments	54.2107
You will put yourself at	27.8953
We and his majesty will	22.3125
If no obstacle occurs we	3035.8525
Once arrived at the brink	883.7590
To horse reechoed Athos everything	347.8546
and rally to the old	1832.6641

Some of the chieftains left	105.9611
There said the king that	828.0411

The king pointed this out	12.6232

About fifteen men were ranged	271.7701
Let us go and die	29.8091
Let us go said Athos	16.0639
All faithful hearts with me	33.5410
This voice was heard by	113.1383

As for Winter at the	235.0042

Fire fire cried Mordaunt returning	100.4328
And wherefore fire said the	807.5701
I recognize him It is	59.9383
I know it And now	41.3830
DArtagnan held the bridle of	68.3065
Both of them attempted to	68.9435
This movement revealed the spot	92.0774
Mordaunt had found it out	487.0136
Athos though now cool and	766.7932
What are you about said	11.3549
Let me kill him We	955.4538

The day has been unfortunate	110.5985
But where is my old	317.2452
In Straffords company said Mordaunt	31.4225
Charles shuddered <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9129
The demon had known how	31.8128
The remembrance of Strafford was	1309.9771
The king looked around him	12.0238
He saw a corpse at	19.1551
It was Winters <PAD> <PAD>	7.4852
He uttered not a word	1870.5879
Lord Winter is killed then	115.6003
Yes said Athos by his	359.3392

You are now master of	1353.0840

What is his bearing Mordaunt	392.8672
Calm and dignified said he	9.9044

Abraham raised the knife against	1176.9152
You are strong among the	2135.6572

Wretched men Their officers wish	189.9406
Are they paid Yes tonight	1537.0594
And now go Mordaunt Before	922.8027
I come to you my	596.4313
The young man remained immovable	14.7216
Yes said Cromwell you have	605.7700
I had no such contempt	1302.5214
But what is the meaning	606.0511
Have they offered you money	12.0144
Do you wish a step	1075.9055
have they then offered a	40.4825
On the contrary I think	801.0211
What said Cromwell arresting him	245.0629

You might have taken Lord	1866.7385
DArtagnan now saw that affairs	391.4279
At the first beat Porthos	159.6225
This movement was observed by	17.7049
Sir he thus addressed DArtagnan	1910.6990
The blood mounted to his	1489.8544

Good thought DArtagnan a quarter	457.4496

Aramis contented himself by making	46.9882
DArtagnans countenance took an expression	485.6750
You can not be speaking	716.0934
This army is commanded by	495.5877
His majesty I can assure	741.8447

So it is agreed and	770.4183
Need we think of that	47.7070
The king savedwe shall assemble	4391.6182

Egad cried DArtagnan its quite	648.2433
There was no response <PAD>	9.8081
He pushed open the door	99.4246
Well cried Porthos <PAD> <PAD>	6.6880
I can see nobody said	16.5429
Aha What Blood At this	261.6966
DArtagnan had already opened the	340.6473
The three friends drew near	869.3444
It was evident that he	516.2579
Athos who imagined that he	134.9662
Well inquired DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	7.0316
Well if he is dead	226.3465
But no his heart is	15.5691
Ho there my friend The	62.3512

The man opened his eyes	236.9970
The wound was in the	194.4377
Aramis dipped a cloth into	155.2818
Again the wounded man opened	445.6125
You are among friends said	618.6288
The man made no reply	11.9989
Make your mind easy resumed	1154.3970
On our honor as gentlemen	55.4151
I am brother to Parry	974.2413
We know him said Athos	67.6822
Well he thought of me	331.7039
They brought him into this	128.9088
Parry knew this room as	244.9928
He knew that there was	713.6561
He made a sign which	660.3703
I went out as if	1649.1656
Alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8417
he would not <PAD> <PAD>	5.9647
But Parry clasped his hands	124.9549
I went on first fortunately	13.5857
The king was a few	825.1024
I wanted to cry out	534.3203
When I came to myself	65.7933
I dragged myself as far	32.6643
The king and his escort	32.0636
I spent perhaps an hour	1003.4875
Can we do anything for	21.5383
Help to put me on	610.8653
But youis there nothing that	1303.0829
neither am I said Porthos	9.1707
They carried the man to	97.4762
In the service of the	872.6407
In the meantime the fugitives	227.7362
Now said Aramis we know	35.2744
The king and his escort	1130.5914
Yes said Porthos let us	1242.1837

This is the first time	771.3990
Do you agree with Aramis	360.6901
you would follow the escort	44.1810
No I would join the	91.2195
Join the escort cried Aramis	11.3150
Let DArtagnan speak said Athos	1033.4496
Now they will be far	1076.6455
It is excellent advice <PAD>	10.3182
I was about to give	239.9873

Besides is he not a	18.1087
Well then Porthos shall show	874.9582
That will insure his confidence	27.3151
You are the best companion	378.7830
At this moment Grimaud came	14.2756
He had stanched the wound	36.0395
The four friends took leave	643.0425
Tell him answered the brave	273.2008
However insignificant I am I	1030.6145
My dear friends said DArtagnan	675.8584
The king was riding in	1396.8398

The lackeys were sent to	1859.7251
DArtagnan was thoughtful and seemed	117.3816
Porthos who could never see	187.5426
He replied in monosyllables and	118.3516
Next morning DArtagnan was the	21.1046

At eight oclock the march	741.8369

It was there a lodging	32.1243
At the hour agreed upon	24.5003
DArtagnan received him as he	108.1765
Porthos scanned him from head	802.6714
Athos and Aramis suppressed as	1142.3861
In short Groslow seemed to	58.2615

To any one not acquainted	674.8646
What is he contriving asked	16.3271
Wait said Athos <PAD> <PAD>	6.0350

Where and when have you	159.0316

Aramis smiled as one who	16.3311

Impossible said DArtagnan those beer	126.7832
Besides you will strike at	1480.5551
Nonsense said DArtagnan you would	28.9641
Humanity in a battle <PAD>	7.8840
But if you think the	676.6007
At this moment a soldier	163.0993
Where asked DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	6.4798
In the room of the	72.5987
Good replied Athos whose blood	1081.2002
The lackeys had been ordered	1354.2006
It was nine oclock in	1007.7778
DArtagnan and Porthos armed with	966.6583
The two latter followed their	310.9543
Ods bodikins said Groslow as	648.0832
Aha said Groslow on account	36.6619
No matter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4916
On the contrary he added	288.1841
Are we to pass the	51.7928
No but in the one	332.8973
Have you provided yourself with	16.3906
I assure you I intend	737.1148
Very good said Groslow and	35.5971
I will show you the	35.1773
DArtagnan turned to look at	16.4246
Porthos was perfectly indifferent Athos	693.9662
The eight guards were at	28.2715
Four in the kings room	315.9629
Athos smiled when he saw	937.3325
Charles was perceived through the	824.6304
A candle of coarse tallow	1180.0592
From time to time Parry	1194.7986
Capital cried the Gascon you	1074.4464
It is impossible to say	1460.6138
Parry too started and stopped	18.8330
What are you thinking about	1131.9934
On a table in the	357.7015
Gentlemen said Groslow I beg	45.8823
I will sit facing Stuart	1020.8082
DArtagnan frowned at him <PAD>	9.5777
Thats it said DArtagnan you	252.5752
You Chevalier dHerblay to his	16.9538
Du Vallon next me <PAD>	9.8565
Youll bet for me and	1655.6614
At the names Comte de	1560.4385
At that moment Parry turned	1998.9839
The words that Parry had	838.2462
DArtagnans eyes sparkled with joy	15.0456
You asked me just now	557.3839
Well in my turn I	941.6569
So much the better said	12.2036
Fight my dear captain fight	13.4554
You know or you dont	96.8510
yes said Groslow bursting with	2350.2827
A slight color mounted to	28.5674
The soldiers then saw him	1471.2534
Athos and Aramis started with	214.2892
The game began <PAD> <PAD>	8.3672
The luck had turned and	752.2544
Porthos who had lost the	884.6061
Athos and Aramis looked at	19.7438
But DArtagnan remained impassible <PAD>	12.1438
It struck ten <PAD> <PAD>	7.7253
They heard the guard going	27.0256
How many rounds do they	362.8954
Five answered Groslow one every	785.1767
Meanwhile the soldiers whose duty	849.1995
Those on the other side	1262.4193
The two sentinels at the	1110.0256
Athos seemed to grow calm	60.6211
With his white aristocratic hands	1283.4789
Aramis less selfcontrolled fumbled continually	93.3939
Porthos impatient at his continued	269.2222
DArtagnan turned mechanically looking behind	1346.0547
DArtagnan saw that the moment	14.2312
He darted a preparatory glance	1608.3746
He gave Porthos a second	988.4690
Hang it cried DArtagnan another	33.6383
Really Captain Groslow you are	63.3949
This cant last and he	66.6917
One more turn captain twenty	651.1420
And he turned up two	293.1583
A king said DArtagnan its	1509.5714
Groslow began turning the cards	31.8828
If he turned up an	148.4778
He turned up a king	10.9747
At last cried DArtagnan <PAD>	8.8052
At this word Athos and	27.7076
Porthos drew back a step	12.9099
Daggers and swords were just	1086.6530
Behind this man could be	179.1873
Groslow jumped up ashamed at	335.3355
But Harrison paid not the	1075.9465
Prepare yourself then to start	254.8555
By General Oliver Cromwell <PAD>	14.0944
And here is Mr Mordaunt	1531.6980
DArtagnan swept up the money	355.4223
Athos and Aramis placed themselves	20.9063
At this movement Mordaunt turned	351.3965
Im afraid we are prisoners	46.9929
Not yet replied Porthos <PAD>	9.1570
Colonel colonel cried Mordaunt you	25.7334
These four Frenchmen have escaped	342.1032
Arrest them Ah <PAD> <PAD>	7.0002
my young man said DArtagnan	289.2002
Fly friends fly he added	69.5243
The next moment he darted	611.1362
Athos and Aramis followed him	10.0754
Porthos brought up the rear	1324.7129
Fire cried Mordaunt fire upon	1679.2150
The horses were at the	264.8173
Forward cried DArtagnan and spur	935.1718
A few hundred yards beyond	98.1834
Halt he cried this time	30.4988
We must let them leave	869.6445
DArtagnan led his horse under	53.5211
The others followed <PAD> <PAD>	7.8089
Ten minutes later they heard	141.5924
A few minutes more and	73.4371
Chapter LXII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6342
London <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8432
As soon as the noise	662.3962
This time said DArtagnan when	761.2546
What do you say Athos	21.5722
Isnt it reasonable Yes dear	724.9526
You said Let us die	960.5948
What troubles me is the	30.3005
As things are turning out	922.3619
Whatever happens let us not	65.0312
Dont you agree with me	50.3863
Then too I confess I	145.6710
It appears to me that	404.9156
thats another thing said DArtagnan	811.7911
Only let us lodge with	1181.0630
Athos do you know any	3138.6558
De Winter took us to	592.0944
What do you say to	1295.7164
We will invoke the remembrance	819.7126
I dont see why we	669.4314
Our clothes have a cut	133.9862
Now I dont set sufficient	2037.8990
I shall buy a chestnutcolored	25.3679
Ive remarked that your Puritans	617.5693
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
to be sure yes <PAD>	9.6079
He lives at the Bedford	70.4311
Besides I can find my	647.8057
They were stopped and questioned	732.1919
That reply led to several	1643.1624
The way was therefore opened	223.7128
Athos was right <PAD> <PAD>	6.3020
He went direct to the	899.1996
Though it was scarcely daylight	1529.2554
The plan of changing their	70.7364
The landlord sent out for	799.8307
Athos chose a black coat	204.8519
Aramis not wishing to part	389.3492
Porthos was seduced by a	108.9625
DArtagnan who had fixed on	1485.5066
Now said DArtagnan for the	16.5059
We must cut off our	152.7790
As we no longer wear	402.9520
This as you know is	1223.2911
We look hideous said Athos	13.4457
And smack of the Puritan	72.7344
My head feels actually cold	33.3312
As for me I feel	91.0401
Now said Athos that we	848.6805
A carriage had been sent	1161.5160
DArtagnan raised himself on tiptoe	582.2392
The next day Athos leaning	859.2424
Parliament indeed cried Athos <PAD>	9.2835
Parliament can never have passed	281.4156
Did parliament pass this act	65.6944
Yes my lord the pure	158.1867
Are there then two parliaments	1142.9980
excellent said Aramis <PAD> <PAD>	6.1300
As to Porthos all his	157.5100
You were asking then said	33.1894
I asked said Athos in	1318.8960
I understand what you say	321.9530
Oh the devil said Porthos	569.4407
really said DArtagnan these people	30.6802
When I go back to	681.4331
One of them will weed	241.3313
Now of two hundred and	995.1676
He took them up just	802.2589
Very And all these one	117.4199
Without doubt senor and you	1167.2574
Now Athos said DArtagnan do	953.9597
But said Aramis if they	1283.2354
We shall see said Athos	627.7153
And I too added Aramis	11.5686
Touching unanimity cried DArtagnan which	111.9161
Let us take a turn	1231.2089
The Trial <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.4547
The next morning King Charles	1305.5570
All London was crowding to	40.2820
The throng was terrific and	1879.3783
When they did so they	1295.7004
Toward eleven oclock the king	1329.4272
The judges proud of having	1778.1178
Charles without replying a single	830.9491
Then when the officer was	700.0059
Parry who accompanied him stood	22.6312
DArtagnan was looking at Athos	1638.9055
This agitation in one so	89.1915
I hope he whispered to	777.7161
Aha continued DArtagnan it is	1014.8342
They had only halberds before	44.2439
The halberds were for the	1922.1711
Ah said Aramis but you	113.9588
He recognized Mordaunt who with	608.4025
Do you think they have	26.8076
In that case I should	28.9167
I dont care to be	241.0459
He sees no one but	18.3520
Mon Dieu <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1238
how he stares at him	33.7206
Does he hate his majesty	1025.1476
the president is speaking to	1319.1777
Bradshaw waited and as there	89.5595
Out of the hundred and	1608.7727
When the name of Colonel	2009.6316
Colonel Fairfax repeated Bradshaw <PAD>	16.6024
Fairfax answered a laughing voice	558.9800
It is a womans voice	1025.6156
By my soul said Aramis	25.7413
Look DArtagnan everybody is looking	1400.0900
Dont you remember Porthos we	240.8035
These rascals will adjourn when	1043.7804
You dont know them <PAD>	9.1529
Athos look at Mordaunts smile	15.7936
Is that the look of	97.5061
Ah cursed basilisk it will	985.8133
The feather in his hat	102.2696
Look at it Aramis The	509.7508
Athos turned pale <PAD> <PAD>	7.4737
A second time he was	36.7791
Notwithstanding the judges were so	341.9090
I told you so Athos	46.7050
Now take your courage in	919.5549
Charles listened with marked attention	3618.0115
The fact is said DArtagnan	861.7285
But it seems to me	910.0165
Meantime DArtagnan who is full	162.8218
I must speak to him	1946.6086
At this moment the accuser	877.7408
You lie it cried <PAD>	9.7436
Ninetenths of the English people	648.5828
King judges spectators all turned	312.4865
Mordaunt did the same and	585.7616
His eyes glittered with delight	15.8528
He had discovered those to	74.9028
A movement of fury called	1053.0449
But with the rapidity of	799.6442
Charles also had recognized the	23.0505
He put one hand on	517.8197
Mordaunt pale and trembling with	2915.5527
The tumult was indescribable <PAD>	11.7845
More than half an hour	126.6331
The judges were looking for	88.3036
The spectators saw the muskets	976.0049
Quiet was at length restored	12.6293
What have you to say	79.1552
Then rising with his head	542.4388
Before questioning me he said	32.3435
I was free at Newcastle	196.9599
Instead of performing your part	1241.2091
But because you have paid	578.3918
No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8453
To answer you would be	20.4648
I shall only reply to	174.2142
To answer you would be	643.9750
Why are not my Frenchmen	782.5730
We will judge you in	30.0205
You are accused of treason	85.1554
The evidence will support it	14.4416
Go and another sitting will	1299.0293
Well my dear Parry said	548.5062
Speak said Charles attempting to	192.0015
It isbut you will not	1402.2333
The sight is hideous Fools	380.3444
You have done well to	18.7007
Thank you Parry When the	208.4696
As he passed the table	418.0757
the axe an ingenious device	1176.0024
When he reached the door	625.1932
How many people thought he	975.7616
It was an old soldier	972.7587
But the next moment the	1394.6887
Alas said Charles that is	1257.7003
Loud roars of laughter and	86.5598
The crowd opened and closed	1236.4597
Charles wiped his face and	1095.6814
Athos and his friends again	471.4847
When the soldier saluted Charles	2026.5980
But when the cowardly insulter	690.3621
But DArtagnan stopped his hand	145.0226
DArtagnan leaning on Athos made	599.5836
The man took his way	25.3930
The four friends followed him	12.4076
The man who had the	898.7706
Arrived at the bank of	844.5266
I dont know English Athos	1110.8798
You have insulted a defenseless	19.6102
You have befouled the face	24.1736
You must die Athos pale	1104.1243
Aramis at this movement drew	21.1104
No cried DArtagnan no steel	13.5873
Steel is for gentlemen And	636.6094
The man fell like an	55.9105
His companions horrorstruck could neither	86.2565
Tell them this Athos resumed	790.9324
The fellows looked at the	2273.4265
Justice is done said Porthos	29.4726
And now said DArtagnan to	1628.1633
Whitehall <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8426
The parliament condemned Charles to	92.8104
Political judgments are generally vain	1855.8060
Such is the atrocious logic	27.2899
Although our friends were expecting	114.9894
DArtagnan whose mind was never	3010.0852
But by what means <PAD>	8.7965
As yet he could form	197.1519
Meanwhile it was necessary at	648.0931
The only way of doing	142.6460
The headsman out of the	76.6694
True they could send for	656.8921
DArtagnan took upon himself that	46.3263
Another thing not less essential	1046.6912
Aramis assumed that perilous charge	18.0875
Charles Stuart had asked that	174.1943
Mordaunt had called on the	721.5033
Aramis determined to obtain from	1572.3998
Finally Athos undertook to provide	1582.7476
The night having come they	1048.5859
The palace of Whitehall was	1531.5533
Alone in his usual room	2134.4731
Parry had not quitted his	186.5661
Charles leaning on a table	905.6819
At times he thought of	760.1189
In fact he sometimes asked	554.7435
He rose and took a	738.7845
He was thereupon constrained to	637.8482
Charles returned in silence to	888.9144
Alas he said to himself	583.6694
But I shall have a	601.0971
He will speak to me	635.3206
It was a dull foggy	19.4208
A neighboring church clock slowly	51.4584
The flickering light of the	464.2025
These were the ancestors of	243.4149
An awful sadness enveloped the	44.4511
He buried his brow in	507.2529
He drew from his breast	780.9328
Then in that chamber which	1517.4834
That king who was so	872.7161
Suddenly the door opened an	2037.5386
The guards retired the room	40.9913
Juxon cried Charles Juxon thank	1413.5587
Come Parry said the king	1183.8551
The chevalier murmured Charles <PAD>	12.9462
Yes sire interrupted Aramis raising	5658.0352
You he said you <PAD>	6.2714
how did you penetrate hither	14.9996
If they recognize you you	233.5247
You see your friends are	18.6020
I know not what we	174.0023
Meanwhile do not be surprised	838.5252
Do you know that I	924.3939
At this moment a strange	791.6451
Do you hear said the	11.2051
I hear said Aramis but	591.8223
Do you know that I	69.4001
Well these boards you hear	382.3995
Some workmen must have fallen	436.3260
You see said the king	57.8547
I am condemned leave me	1029.0068
I mean that at this	565.6689
The scaffold will be ready	857.2216
Tomorrow night we shall rescue	827.7032
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
sir cried Parry may you	255.5500
I must know so that	669.5585
Do not forget for a	1681.6958
There is no word though	887.7025
If you succeed I do	408.0041
Chevalier take my hand it	481.8017
At this moment a man	70.5387
Aramis tried to withdraw his	72.5388
The man was one of	499.0587
What do you want sir	18.5645
I desire to know if	246.6480
And what is it to	482.9440
One of my brothers is	656.3995
Chevalier said the king when	361.3194
Take care that no misfortune	1167.8527
Juxon was waiting for him	15.4789
Well said he on perceiving	13.5660
Everything has succeeded as I	1432.9901
He had scarcely gone ten	699.8647
He placed his hand on	32.3730
The man came straight toward	18.0514
It was Porthos <PAD> <PAD>	6.0170
My dear friend cried Aramis	12.1153
You see we had each	395.8960
Have you seen the king	753.2052
Arrived at the hotel it	43.8107
Alls well he cried as	1249.5865
It is waiting for us	1303.5378
Once on board we drop	339.3002
In case I am killed	397.2960
A handkerchief tied at the	344.2011
Empty your pockets said he	829.5650
The sum was collected in	22.7077
DArtagnan ran out and returned	23.6810
There said he its done	10.3842
Ough <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8476
and not without a deal	258.1382
Ah you see that plan	819.9366
Mousqueton is propped against the	2050.5632
Five hundred pounds And where	132.8517
Had you then that sum	177.4918
Ah true said Aramis <PAD>	8.6903
I recognized it on your	572.1682
Yes but it was fated	757.2461
In the excess of his	1058.9757
Heres the letter he sent	800.7431
Cant you guess my dear	15.2558
You who speak English like	1000.1489
Do you understand it now	1205.9181
The letter from the executioners	443.7190

Toward midnight Charles heard a	69.0768
It arose from blows of	564.1797
Lying dressed upon his bed	723.1362
He could not endure it	1029.2002
The sentinel was unwilling to	148.5628
Arriving at the window Parry	1397.7279
Raised to the height of	499.1161
Parry odious as was this	1247.3560
My friends said Parry mounting	613.7523
The king wishes to get	756.6465
The face of the first	427.1980
Very well very well said	82.0036
Tell the king that if	2336.3804
But Parry withdrew thinking he	30.9442
Charles was impatiently awaiting his	18.6557
At the moment he reentered	682.5082
The king was lying on	73.2807
Parry closed the door and	766.0513
No how would you have	554.0952
Yes and at the same	615.2071
Parry was not wrong <PAD>	8.2962
It was Athos he had	184.3186
This hole communicated with a	889.4673
Their plan was to pass	1330.7687
Through this the king was	447.1946
Day gilded the tops of	23.3519
The aperture was finished and	1312.3409
He had only two hours	497.8950
DArtagnan returned to change his	938.6058
As for Aramis he went	761.7106
All three agreed to meet	393.3174
Before leaving the scaffold Aramis	522.4990
Adieu then and be of	24.9244
Report to the king the	18.6813
Say to him that when	424.0710
Try Aramis to keep near	17.8205
Speak loud very loud for	75.0966
If there is a sentinel	99.1664
If there are two let	60.6634
If there are three let	1464.6205
Is that all Yes go	360.8034
While you are fighting if	80.8991
The trap once replaced over	1733.9207
In those ten minutes we	881.2905
Your hand for perhaps we	1398.8715
For you he said <PAD>	6.2624
Now if I die say	255.8891
Embrace also our good and	22.2884
Adieu Adieu said Aramis <PAD>	9.8124
I am as sure now	686.2286
He found the other two	1304.0986
Porthos was cursing the infamous	1222.3582
Aramis related what had been	24.3188
DArtagnan approved with a movement	69.1283
Bravo he said besides we	73.1604
What with DArtagnan Grimaud and	151.3775
I say nothing about Blaisois	124.3451
Two minutes a man makes	22.8914
Mousqueton will lose another thats	1400.1681
Now said he Im off	25.1158
Take care of the executioner	28.6343
Grimaud has relieved Mousqueton and	1492.6981
Ask Porthos <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.0826
I pass my life upon	190.4311
Juxon consented the more readily	896.4619
Dressed as Aramis had been	653.1014
The carriage stopped at the	25.3932
It was about nine oclock	23.2768
Nothing was changed <PAD> <PAD>	6.8660
The anterooms were still full	222.9761
The king was already sanguine	205.7603
He embraced Juxon and pressed	37.1338
The bishop affected to speak	358.5844
The king replied that the	834.7051
Juxon turned to those present	287.0648
Every one withdrew <PAD> <PAD>	7.5565
As soon as the door	1114.3478

Two feet below you take	421.5182
He will answer you The	1863.9723
So said Charles he who	473.1080
He is preparing a way	40.8218
Parry for his part will	975.8421
Aramis seized the poker and	298.5062
It was that of a	44.4943
The four men stood motionless	16.0087
All eyes were fixed on	196.3907
A parliamentary officer clothed in	1847.9752
What is this said Aramis	16.6049
Juxon replied with a sign	180.9292
Then it is for today	19.2275
Was not your majesty warned	964.6793
The execution will therefore only	3428.1440
But Aramis was livid <PAD>	9.7707
His heart ceased beating he	132.3031
Charles perceived it and took	16.5547
Come my friend said he	53.4633
Sir I am ready <PAD>	8.2272
There is but little reason	43.7622
Firstly I wish to communicate	605.4304
Will this be permitted me	82.9950
Aramis dug his nails into	98.9066
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
my lord bishop he cried	127.6372
where is Providence My son	1414.1500
You ask what God is	17.0264
God beholds your devotion and	288.6761
Ascribe to men then what	43.3961
It is men who drive	792.3778
It is men whom I	1690.2407
I have now to confess	13.7863
Remain sir he added to	67.5843
Remain Parry <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9119

Remember <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8445
The mob had already assembled	63.5556
The kings children next arrivedthe	3721.0342
He had wept all night	190.3266
Charless heart melted within him	748.4449
He turned to brush away	1970.8087
Then he took the boy	25.0468
My son he said to	326.3043
These men are going to	28.6589
Do not forget that <PAD>	7.9903
Perhaps some day they will	887.9375
But you are not the	178.7031

Farewell said Charles farewell my	19.9237
Take them away Juxon their	1269.3827
Meanwhile Athos in his concealment	181.3792
Two long hours he waited	38.9935
A deathlike silence reigned in	40.8196
At last he determined to	64.4863
He crept from his hole	307.1010
Peeping out from the drapery	912.5403
What is the matter then	439.0410
The people are hurrying on	246.4144
What is he waiting for	9.4978
What is he looking at	9.3310
Good God <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4265
have they allowed the headsman	859.8752
The sound of heavy steps	52.6655
The next moment the very	1284.7881
At the same moment a	1048.3715
It was the king speaking	20.0677
In fact after taking a	1316.3401
Then the two wings of	1086.6774
He approached the block and	58.4991
Behind him pale indeed but	1829.0132
The sight of the masked	108.8963
Every one was full of	972.3691
All gazed at him searchingly	15.1815
But they could discern nothing	1135.5057
The kings request had undoubtedly	2687.7651
Oh said Athos to himself	348.2149
Is it possible that God	858.1422
And I have not seen	11.0878
I have not said adieu	737.4583
Do not touch the axe	71.3393
At the end of his	119.8200
Then unfastening the diamond ornament	578.2018
Then he drew from his	751.9782
Sir said he to the	229.7571
Take it from me when	371.4146
He then took his hat	92.9757
One by one he undid	636.9510
Then as it was cold	108.3207
All the preparations were made	38.1929
One would have thought the	96.9069
Will these be in your	716.0640
His calm noble gaze forced	98.8384
But after the searching look	139.4218
The king seeing that he	58.8670
It will do replied the	919.2638
Do you think you can	113.8322
I hope so was the	12.9413
There was something so strange	218.0192
I do not wish to	60.4106
I shall kneel down to	1599.1543
Farewell He looked at Aramis	138.5270
Now he continued withdraw a	167.5334
You also stand aside he	46.6930
It is only for a	236.6703
Faithful friend noble heart said	91.7878
I have addressed my people	200.6927
To maintain a cause which	635.1276
A million in gold remains	268.6582
You only know that this	22.5364
Make use of it then	658.0599
And now farewell Farewell saintly	417.9914
A moments silence ensued and	1662.8550
He reeled back with a	413.4944
Athos fell on his knees	192.7677
At last he rose and	315.9180
Then as the crowd gradually	2290.0110
Having gained his room he	790.0157

The Man in the Mask	14.4261
The snow was falling thick	34.8567
Aramis was the next to	77.4860
But at the first words	815.2855
Well said Aramis beaten by	53.3347
Noble and unhappy king Are	41.1401
No this is his blood	982.9078
God preserve me from another	657.0565
And what he continued has	1271.6667
The doctors are embalming the	1614.0969
We are all mortal my	913.2829
The wretches were dancing <PAD>	13.6284
I took one of them	84.0576
Just then a patrol rode	19.6922
Luckily the man I had	416.2719
He was in the front	555.4152
They were anxious about you	97.7701
You didnt know King Charles	683.6339
Ugh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8406
I am tired cried DArtagnan	26.4510
Drink a glass of port	875.3542
The felucca is waiting for	822.6879
But what would you have	613.7871
Well for my part I	883.7001
Every reproach his friend uttered	61.2556
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
you remain in London said	16.2083
Yes <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8439
And you Hang it said	580.3732
I cant leave you alone	196.9062
So I have a little	99.4028
I want to find out	803.8948
You did not let the	737.3964
But you remind me <PAD>	8.8299
Mousqueton Sir answered a voice	53.7167
Let out your prisoner <PAD>	8.9742
All is over But said	820.2577
He wore a mask But	1013.7001
When one puts on a	961.4390
Well my dear Porthos said	661.5777
Pardon me DArtagnan he said	8.4484
I have distrusted God I	72.6607
Pardon me my friend We	217.6578
Well then said Aramis <PAD>	7.7837
Well while I was watchingnot	728.0771
Now as we are wont	906.4492
I was looking around for	611.3697
Humph thought I that looks	1665.0289
Well this man was making	466.4141
Oh said I to him	7.4936
Grimaud turned round with a	186.5878
Eh said he which meant	445.5277
Well everything was finished as	17.8345
The mob dispersed <PAD> <PAD>	10.0815
I made a sign to	463.2843
I saw the executioner return	1112.1576
Five minutes later he came	185.5287
I should think so but	26.4951
Every few minutes he turned	139.5957
I might have gone up	34.9030
But I am not selfish	412.7198
So we followed him through	736.4645
Grimaud drew out a pistol	12.7123
Eh said he showing it	10.1534
I held back his arm	12.9730
The man in the mask	596.4799
Grimaud and I got behind	1085.9563
Next moment the door opened	82.8010
While you have been returning	831.0925
Before he had taken ten	263.5526
At one of the doors	449.4839
Then going around the house	177.3521
Our game is beaten up	15.1612
Now for the tallyho Athos	67.0986
Friend he said you have	348.8415
I ought to have known	1134.0659
Dont you think the executioner	817.9771
just so <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.8516
Cromwell is stout and short	3864.7090
If I am not mistaken	173.1309
Impossible <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8443
It would be a dishonor	1240.5653
Fine sport Are you still	96.5626
No I remain replied Athos	500.1147
Swords then cried Aramis swords	13.0759
let us not lose a	2184.6104
The night was dark snow	156.1486
DArtagnan led the way through	1352.1512
For a moment DArtagnan thought	140.7167
The robust Scotchman accustomed to	2266.7878
He rose however as they	17.3258
Come said Athos heres another	26.0930
Really honest men are not	1847.7637
I believe the fellow is	941.8451
I should not like to	329.4485
No one has come out	16.7939
Then Porthos and Aramis will	564.1273
Soho cried Athos <PAD> <PAD>	6.6196
Yes said Grimaud <PAD> <PAD>	6.4196
Well has anybody come out	904.7781
ah said DArtagnan there are	521.9656
What do you mean Other	1160.9086
At the same time he	388.7264
That is true said DArtagnan	585.3048
Have you seen anything they	14.6329
No but we are going	1063.5072
All four came up together	13.9511
Grimaud continued to climb like	1617.5479
Then resting his foot on	353.7932
Well asked DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	6.4859
Grimaud showed his closed hand	66.7462
Speak said Athos we can	30.6781
How many are there Two	13.9780
One opposite to me the	50.3911
And the man opposite to	386.2507
Short and stout Who is	141.5783
General Oliver Cromwell The four	65.4256
And the other asked Athos	9.7580
Thin and lanky The executioner	82.6650
I can see nothing but	36.2363
But wait <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5288
He is moving and if	247.4355
Ah And as if struck	333.4602
Did you see him they	15.0956
Yes said Grimaud with his	33.7290
The thin spare man Yes	97.4478
Yes And who is it	14.6946
Heheis murmured Grimaud pale as	113.5179
Who <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8434
He asked Athos <PAD> <PAD>	6.6388
Mordaunt replied Grimaud <PAD> <PAD>	7.0119
DArtagnan Porthos and Aramis uttered	31.2539
Athos stepped back and passed	55.0377
Fatality he muttered <PAD> <PAD>	6.7216
Chapter LXVIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6605
Cromwells House <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.2360
It was in fact Mordaunt	79.1871
On entering the house he	1305.5333
This man was Cromwell <PAD>	8.4597
Cromwell had two or three	594.1839
Mordaunt was among these <PAD>	8.8541
It is you Mordaunt he	10.6248
You are late General I	279.9637
I scarcely thought you were	963.6838
But you general were you	58.1111
There was a moments silence	11.2671
Have you had any account	24.1208
I have been here since	16.8501
I only know that there	289.7399
It matters little <PAD> <PAD>	7.8675
Four men disguised as workmen	947.3821
But who told you I	765.7113
Cromwell smiled <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5924
Because it could have been	347.0071
But he will not avow	1466.0151
Now that they are guilty	1020.7498
Mordaunt bowed with a smile	34.7344
Did the people shout at	28.6719
Very little except Long live	1653.6321
But his piercing eyes could	251.1341
I was so situated as	63.4499
It was now Cromwells turn	340.3129
It appears said Cromwell that	204.6543
The blow so they tell	969.3369
In fact said Mordaunt with	1346.6954
Do you think so sir	10.0296
He did not look like	1771.2042
Perhaps it was some man	898.3901
It rests between his conscience	1145.1163
Provided Charles is dead it	518.7351
They would have carried him	1006.6866
Once out to sea you	628.6522
The explosion would have done	86.0699
Men would have said that	246.7380
You see now why I	543.3972
Sir he said you are	1094.2482
The only sublime ideas in	113.5789
So tonight Mordaunt go to	208.5647
Show him a white handkerchief	1610.8983
You are going sir Yes	20.2154
I slept here last night	621.7879
Since last evening he added	788.6829
Are you armed he asked	10.8240
I have my sword And	818.0984
It closed after him with	20.1659
This door communicated with a	883.9437
It was just before this	124.5393
DArtagnan was the first to	26.3461
Mordaunt he cried <PAD> <PAD>	5.9301
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
by Heaven <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.6942
it is God Himself who	933.7209
Now Grimaud you come here	709.8181
If he comes out we	28.3630
If he stays in we	41.4289
It is easier and less	319.5433
Keep guard at the other	27.0293
Porthos and I will stay	35.1609
He is alone said Grimaud	10.5415
We did not see his	1014.2595
Porthos mechanically drew his dagger	40.5437
Put it up again my	20.7676
We must proceed in an	203.8170
He has put out the	791.1719
The snow deadened the noise	35.4059
Now go and tell Athos	641.6149
We will do the same	567.8151
Porthos clapped his hands and	70.4211
Mordaunt was livid but he	108.6005
DArtagnan quietly pushed him in	684.8260
At last they stood face	986.8640
Porthos came up behind and	250.0600
Athos and Aramis entered last	53.0412
Oblige me by taking a	815.0613
Aramis Porthos and DArtagnan drew	39.3102
Athos alone kept away and	1038.0481
He seemed to be quite	16.4579
Porthos rubbed his hands in	30.0260
Aramis bit his lips till	32.3119
DArtagnan alone was calm at	26.9922
Monsieur Mordaunt he said since	1338.9025
Conversational <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8438
Though Mordaunt had been so	1479.1261
His eye wandered to a	1739.3064
DArtagnan was waiting for a	52.3682
Aramis muttered to himself We	3675.4634
The silence however could not	26.8082
So DArtagnan began Sir he	1070.8145
Just now DArtagnan continued you	1272.7223
sir said DArtagnan how can	398.6791
I had the honor of	77.5582
The mask and beard became	560.6310
Why then have you laid	1591.1039
What took place at Armentieres	175.8526
We could scarcely have requested	244.9861
It is a duel then	294.9948
Porthos rose always ready for	42.6944
Pardon me said DArtagnan <PAD>	7.2099
Do not let us do	30.8898
We will arrange the matter	24.6139
Confess Monsieur Mordaunt that you	175.6884
Then my dear sir I	802.2925
Of course they will do	978.9937
At your service sir he	14.5731
My sword is shorter than	93.8430
I think the arm will	228.8479
I begin and without any	92.1183
Athos did not move <PAD>	9.5208
He might have been taken	26.6928
Even his breathing seemed to	21.8516
Gentlemen said DArtagnan you shall	19.4831
Monsieur Mordaunt dislikes you sufficiently	64.5295
You can see it in	15.9228
So pray keep your places	202.7671
Besides we will have no	21.2803
I have particular business to	1018.5016
You are disputing which shall	907.8005
I hate you all but	21.0875
I hope to kill all	441.1448
I claim then the right	41.9563
If you refuse this right	651.1448
Athos and DArtagnan said nothing	87.2285
Well then said Mordaunt I	769.6318
Submit this honour to somebody	73.9107
Ah said Mordaunt with a	1719.8317
Is it your decision Athos	28.3551
Irrevocably You hear sir said	35.0095
The Comte de la Fere	129.5864
Choose one of us to	772.6528
Put your names into a	200.4385
At least that will conciliate	36.9388
I should never have thought	642.8742
He stood with his arms	408.5634
If he had not courage	112.6022
Aramis went to Cromwells desk	2305.0474
He then rolled them separately	271.6421
Mordaunt put his hand into	736.2974
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
serpent muttered DArtagnan I would	658.5646
The moment that DArtagnan saw	547.5677
He turned up his cuffs	1555.6644
Are you ready sir he	19.3981
I was waiting for you	685.5902
Well then said the Gascon	626.5643
Defend yourself One minute said	28.2578
Give me your word gentlemen	599.4607
On the honor of gentlemen	22.9145
In that case gentlemen have	583.8965
We shall require it Yes	1478.6261
The space was cleared the	1726.3999
DArtagnan was too good a	73.4700
He made a rapid and	85.3500
Aha he cried with a	21.6007
And without losing a minute	1358.8254
This time it was Mordaunt	18.2987
Ah sir said DArtagnan you	29.0744
It must have been the	874.0275
Mordaunt rapidly sprang back a	20.3610
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
you lose ground you are	16.9248
Well as you please I	641.4179
You have no idea what	171.9868
Look at my eyes and	1804.0792
He smiled more and more	190.7741
Come come cried DArtagnan we	870.5361
However as they were fighting	824.9305
Ah this time you can	101.6546
Gentlemen did you ever see	73.5708
No <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8453
Well then you shall see	765.8519
The three friends looked on	33.8630
At last DArtagnan having got	1506.5081
DArtagnan sprang back the wall	29.7743
Mordaunt in fact while defending	1083.9464
The Gascon uttered a furious	1412.0100
Help me gentlemen cried DArtagnan	952.8564
He escapes us growled Porthos	512.0593
Sblood <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8444
he escapes us So much	50.9879
I thought as much said	112.0605
Zounds I thought as much	110.0990
I thought he was up	586.7476
Its a piece of good	205.1014
Really said DArtagnan abandoning the	2074.0195
You can not understand the	25.1951
In this kind of game	202.7671
This fox of a fellow	2439.0703
Come come we must be	14.8559
If we stay here five	1185.7623
To the hotel to be	748.4274
Chapter LXX <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.5823
The Skiff Lightning DArtagnan had	1306.6594
He knew the rapidity of	896.0900
This time the musketeers had	65.5840
After closing the door carefully	2084.8242
Good he said nothing almost	220.5337
The wounds that I make	690.7430
Now not a second to	119.2530
They must diedie all togetherkilled	643.4778

Fool that I was <PAD>	6.2912
I have almost killed myself	50.0507
Now he added rising in	804.4584
Mordaunt drew a handkerchief from	2275.4124
He was wrapped in a	402.2726
Do you wish to go	48.3203
Yes just so <PAD> <PAD>	6.6121
Along the Isle of Dogs	396.3002
You would like one that	130.1088
Then mine is the boat	23.6129
Im your man I begin	800.2698
Good quite right cried Mordaunt	52.1358
Theres not a moment to	675.3214
I thought there were four	47.0538
Im not the man you	183.7497
under orders from General Cromwell	15.8953
Mine also are from him	371.5642
Oh fear nothing said the	43.3785
I am a friend Captain	32.3718
Himself <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8494
The general remembered that I	712.9136
Is there anything new in	1402.8573
ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8523
the general doubted my fidelity	272.0458
Havent you some one who	320.5408
Patrick said Groslow take this	96.9553
If any one asks you	1275.0670
Now said Mordaunt are you	630.9987
Besides even you didnt recognize	884.3091
Everything is ready is it	3295.8584
Now take me aboard and	892.5241
Besides he doesnt know you	1464.9418
A boat was fastened to	153.2979
Groslow jumped in followed by	882.2324
When they reached the side	1846.9532
He went with Groslow to	1523.2229
They will have nothing to	51.1829
Nothing at all Thats a	28.2797
Return to Greenwich and bring	21.0482
I shall hide myself in	26.5664
You have a longboat That	2069.0547
Put a good supply of	1030.6544
Do you wish to see	23.9607
When you return I will	676.5878
The wind was chilly and	985.9839
These horsemen were our friends	332.5637
As soon as they arrived	714.8849
Athos alighted and calmly opened	2692.9812
On seeing the appointed signal	1684.0510
He was so well wrapped	626.3453
What do you want with	32.8460
I wish to inform you	1241.7887
He fell down this morning	43.6961
But Im his cousin he	609.7623
Was that all he said	15.0226
No my lord he said	1182.3990
It seems a likely story	1062.4808
I dare say you know	642.0961
My father meant me for	960.1315
They then summoned their friends	1581.3174
Thanks to this stroke of	650.8195
Parry parted from his friends	1090.1906
It is very simple Mousqueton	1021.9031
DArtagnan resumed immediately the attitude	91.0331
He found the wharf too	365.7372
He had reported to Aramis	857.8521
A slight click of the	330.5182
We have no time now	31.4862
The boat is waiting for	1823.8921
We can watch the skipper	1540.5104
Let us go then <PAD>	8.5029
You first Mousqueton and he	1191.8665
The three valets passed without	24.4197
Athos followed them then Porthos	19.8323
DArtagnan went last still shaking	23.4931
What in the devil is	49.5616
Upon my word you would	1269.4039
Everything goes as if in	194.3348
But no matter we must	1148.2714
The other sailor had already	273.8239
As soon as there was	916.9964
At last we are off	20.8804
Alas said Athos we depart	1136.4607
Who could intercept us on	1643.7916
Yes Athos you may laugh	1076.1703
much Monsieur Mordaunt would care	13.6744
You dont imagine he would	1231.1930
Oho <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8474
whats that The Lightning answered	345.7162
They went on board and	1462.5854
Stop a moment cried DArtagnan	647.0886
Explain it Athos Groslow on	2341.1489
Oh he exclaimed I begin	967.0400
Athos lend me Grimaud who	978.7827
DArtagnan finding a lantern on	396.7353
This was divided into three	682.1102
Oho cried DArtagnan as he	830.5233
one would think one was	60.0128
What is there in them	138.1629
The captain seemed inclined to	815.5686
port wine <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.6177
tis a comfort said the	106.5819
Are they all full Grimaud	1651.2186
Stop said the Englishman I	316.8076
Here there was evidently nothing	770.5844
This was the room appropriated	21.7575
Two or three hammocks hung	755.5275
DArtagnan picked up two or	2133.2307
And this room he asked	50.5850
Thats my room replied Groslow	12.1397
Open the door The captain	15.8003
DArtagnan stretched out his arm	559.3810
If there is an army	127.8627
Let us see what Porthos	1383.0977
Porthos had found nothing and	95.2071
He had fallen asleep and	115.0227
Athos and Aramis were beginning	578.6006
Well said Aramis <PAD> <PAD>	6.1211
All is well we may	1584.4640

Port Wine <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.5059
In ten minutes the masters	294.3686
Blaisois and Mousqueton set themselves	421.6128
On a hanging table which	1011.7883
This cursed rolling said Blaisois	18.3841
I know it will serve	508.6778
Pah But where is your	62.7850
Have you lost it asked	15.1326
No replied Mousqueton Parry kept	19.3992
Those devilish Scotchmen are always	34.8818
And you Grimaud he said	503.0304
And he sat down and	448.6428
Oh lackadaisy <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.8287
Im beginning to feel queer	33.1717
If thats the case said	2108.6985
Blaisois replied Mousqueton remember that	1223.6411
Monsieur Mousqueton <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4994
The Englishdo they dislike wine	977.7341
For example an English prince	761.0118
I heard the Chevalier dHerblay	1546.8052
How asked Blaisois I can	11.6846
Explain yourself Grimaud went on	93.1838
Port he said extending his	263.1677
Eh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8433
eh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8457
ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8523
Those barrels I saw through	237.3860
I have heard said Blaisois	800.2499
Excellent there is port wine	2600.1643
Sell cried Mousqueton about whom	317.6283
One may well perceive young	52.9581
Why buy what one can	351.0580
That is forbidden it seems	82.0207
In the commandments of God	81.1481
I only know it says	4979.5503
Yes you talk like a	41.0003
Where have you read in	625.4828
If you had been ten	608.1641
Now an Englishman is an	1445.2102
I suppose that you think	1206.5255
Were it liquid gold Monsieur	308.4691
Know that Monsieur de Bracieux	1414.0623
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
locked he exclaimed these devils	403.5760
the deuce it is unlucky	759.3270
But Blaisois ventured to say	1106.1858
I can not throw the	2158.3354
Tis true he said but	789.6485
Ah yes said Mousqueton <PAD>	9.2518
Grimaud in fact was not	428.0297
Mousqueton therefore was soon provided	99.3177
In a few minutes he	49.2716
He tried to pass his	875.5558
He sighed and set to	21.5538
Grimaud had now finished his	17.7690
He arose and stood near	19.4069
I he said <PAD> <PAD>	5.3921
What said Mousqueton <PAD> <PAD>	6.5583
I can pass That is	1428.2089
Let Monsieur Grimaud go in	770.3492
Yes but that would take	66.8088
I am getting more and	1805.5973
Rinse the glasses said Grimaud	11.7714
Then with a friendly gesture	2330.7832
Blaisois was in a state	63.0852
Of all the exploits performed	749.6075
You are about to see	744.3854
What do you want asked	15.8196
My cloakstop up the aperture	66.5030
Simpleton exclaimed Mousqueton suppose any	1268.1256
That is lucky said Blaisois	13.5233
As for me when I	1932.4005
Had you been in the	512.9787
But hark <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.5269
I think some one is	920.8770
Blaisois obeyed <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.8135
The door of their cabin	20.0868
Two men wrapped in their	28.7493
Oho said they not in	55.5126
Thats against all rules <PAD>	11.4887
In a quarter of an	952.6419
Ah cried Blaisois he is	133.8329
They waited for ten minutes	1008.6667
Shall we obey asked Blaisois	14.7883
All this looks suspicious They	72.5865
We still have five minutes	22.8781
Suppose we warn the masters	1503.6825
He held in his hand	1050.7001
Both however cast an inquisitive	214.8677
Convinced that the ship was	1020.5099
Imposing silence Grimaud put out	2683.0913
This was the gist of	1057.4956
He passed on to anotherit	865.0674
At this point Grimaud stopped	971.5284
Whilst he was thinking that	951.1214
This was Groslow <PAD> <PAD>	6.7085
He was accompanied by another	1970.7336
His face was hidden under	82.0577
Grimaud thinking that they had	1209.9944
Have you the wick asked	48.0742
Here it is answered the	11.4038
At the voice of this	710.4617
He rose gently so that	746.2167
How long will this fuse	52.1310
About five minutes replied the	15.2789
That voice also was known	20.3964
He looked from one to	76.2346
Then tell the men to	74.4942
When the clock strikes a	104.4182
Get down into the longboat	316.3051
I wish to be sure	22.7926
Are the oars in the	1610.1218
He then arose <PAD> <PAD>	7.3285
You hear meat a quarter	2297.6543
But what he saw made	218.9887
He had seen the two	1079.0962
Then he felt and felt	533.1617
Mordaunt went away with the	13.5767
At the door he stopped	15.8642
Do you hear how they	24.4972
In fact Porthos could be	69.2544
Tis God who gives them	68.1377
This time the devil himself	73.1861
And they went out together	12.6223
Chapter LXXII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6796
End of the Port Wine	23.2393
Grimaud waited till he heard	687.3595
Ah he said wiping with	1282.0953
It may be imagined that	1796.9326
DArtagnan pressing his hand repeated	24.4430
Aramis obeyed <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.8109
Athos is near you said	1022.0254
But there was more difficulty	32.1117
He was beginning to ask	781.2218
Then our Gascon extending his	1062.8112
Friends he said we must	875.8289
Groslow said Aramis the devil	9.8750
Who is this Groslow asked	14.6805
I dont remember him Groslow	1659.4670
oh And do you know	62.1497
There is none said Athos	11.0051
They dont have lieutenants in	1168.9524
Those invincible men were subject	1125.8014
What shall we do said	12.7142
We must seize the felucca	22.9527
And kill him said Porthos	10.9647
The felucca is mined said	19.6386
Those casks which I took	229.3289
When Mordaunt finds himself discovered	1323.5076
Yes What is it Have	237.4299
Very well come this way	1169.4180
He turned it gently on	28.3235
There he said is our	26.7630

Stay here if you like	1431.1669
We will take possession of	42.3753
Come my friends A moments	263.4475
Meantime the three friends were	1147.3502
Those who have once beheld	1698.0104
Gracious Heaven we are hesitating	971.2727
Sir interposed Blaisois I warn	717.2098
But DArtagnan had now slipped	26.8434
You have decided friend said	15.0540
Yes the Gascon answered Athos	11.1779
you who are a perfect	125.7973
Do you Aramis order the	13.2850
Porthos kill every one who	1055.4257
Athos followed him before the	773.3229
DArtagnan swam to it and	482.9879
In one second Athos joined	17.4780
Then they saw as the	302.2458

Come come said Porthos jump	1614.8721

And I know I shall	77.5822
Come along <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.7085
I shall strangle you both	686.2493
Forward Blaisois A groan stifled	1269.3101
Now Mousqueton he said I	1102.6753
We were all so happy	2205.6167
A sublime action at all	154.5752
But Porthos was not a	786.2756
In a few minutes Porthos	692.3433
Athos was the last to	11.3353
Are you all here he	11.6975
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468

Yes Cut the cable then	637.7770
The felucca went on the	331.6283

Chapter LXIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6621
Fatality <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8466
Scarcely had DArtagnan uttered these	1304.0657
That you may be sure	1082.8558
Suddenly a terrible cry a	1355.9950
Shadows ran as if bewildered	935.7592
In the midst of these	360.1159
The agitated figures apparently wild	2069.7327
Mordaunt after having listened at	800.2545
Then he had run to	782.9716
All this while Groslow and	69.6655
Haul up the cable and	66.4721
One of the sailors got	572.1398
The cable is cut he	48.2459
no boat exclaimed Groslow it	1533.4781
Only that our enemies have	1038.6844
Empty he exclaimed the infernal	2075.3816
The instant Groslow put his	961.6187
A burst of flame rose	2380.5161
Onlythe felucca had disappeared from	450.8159
The four friends saw all	389.0691
At one moment bathed as	901.5029
Soon a torrent of vivid	3936.1707
They sat silent and dejected	16.1804
By Heaven at last said	569.0709
save me <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.7149
help cried a voice whose	1294.7567
All looked around Athos himself	21.0958
Tis he <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.5091
it is his voice All	615.9312
After a minute or two	475.6233
Athos extended his arm toward	89.7269
Yes yes I see him	29.7377
Heagain cried Porthos who was	1562.9011
Aramis and DArtagnan whispered to	18.0037
Mordaunt made several strokes more	2223.8135
my strength is failing me	1731.6906
Poor fellow he exclaimed <PAD>	8.7840
Indeed said DArtagnan monsters have	104.5656

Porthos murmured the Comte de	23.4851
Oh pray for mercys sake	61.4365
For pitys sake cried the	2286.4932
DArtagnan however who had consulted	85.9566

You would have done what	864.0227
Alas he said I am	16.6172

Surely if I am culpable	824.3057
Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484

Mordaunt reappeared <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1682
For my part said DArtagnan	457.8976
executioner as you were of	17.8125
incendiary <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8454
I recommend you to sink	2120.1006
DArtagnan cried Athos my son	595.6568

Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
Comte de la Fere you	62.9632

Now sir said the count	43.5417
my mother cried Mordaunt with	1313.4659
For an instant without an	1002.0865
Mute with horror the three	2075.6826
Porthos was the first who	16.8067
He tore his hair <PAD>	10.5929
Oh he cried Athos <PAD>	7.7738
Athos <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8466
thou man of noble heart	28.2982
I have let thee perish	965.7065
In the bosom of this	666.6384
Mordaunt <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8456
Mordaunt cried the three friends	70.4193
Suddenly the boat leaned on	1454.3187
Eight vigorous arms lifted him	2644.2183
You are not hurt asked	15.9525
No replied Athos and he	14.4161
now we may say at	31.4483
he is really dead <PAD>	9.1843
Look and DArtagnan obliging Athos	964.7491
At last he sank <PAD>	9.8120
Athos had followed him with	210.4801
Bravo <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8493
Athos cried Aramis with an	48.4169
A capital blow you gave	24.8915
I have a son <PAD>	7.5581
I wished to live said	14.2353
In short said DArtagnan this	376.1367
How Mousqueton had a Narrow	56.3738
A deep silence reigned for	336.6194
The moon which had shone	1570.5332
Porthos was the first to	10.3113
I have seen he said	743.8123
Nevertheless even in my present	184.3261
I have a hundred pounds	70.7765
I breathe more freely In	1642.3022
For my part observed Aramis	111.5538
I am still terrified to	135.1319
I look around the boat	1692.3392
I feel easy replied Porthos	14.3141
The poniard was pointed at	426.2262
I do not reproach you	44.0112
On the contrary when one	198.1932
So now I breathe againI	2472.0518
Men may subdue menthey can	72.2283
We are now on the	1766.9325
You are ungrateful DArtagnan said	1640.3090
Let us sail before the	1342.2296
Should our bark be upset	1677.2495
Now we are on the	1179.0271
Tis more than possible answered	57.3919
Mousqueton sighed again more deeply	29.0718
What is the matter <PAD>	7.1962
what ails you asked Porthos	12.6455
I am cold sir said	16.5268
Impossible <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8443
your body is covered with	460.1396
sir tis this very coating	333.7443
Alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8417
your honor in the library	1464.3132
Yes sir answered Mousqueton but	176.2002
However he added turning to	719.8202
Suddenly Mousqueton uttered a cry	959.7305
Oh sir he cried passing	2574.0867
Zounds exclaimed Porthos tis astonishing	2738.7554

When the sergeant on entering	814.2649
Be it so said Athos	624.4406
There seems to be only	833.1785
Merciful goodness whispered Aramis to	87.8638

Now if they believed us	1122.4576
However Im glad not to	53.3082

He commanded a retreat which	2131.0906
De Chatillon saw him fall	986.9863
Suddenly a squadron of cavalry	2687.3486

Oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484

I will not miss you	884.7390
Aramis awaited him with that	698.7114
fire then when the shot	19.5995
De Chatillon opened his arms	135.1290
The ball had entered his	110.1366
I am a dead man	87.4354
I told you this I	90.3389

He turned around and seized	1459.7483
The young man recognized at	609.7841
My prisoner he cried <PAD>	8.4833
Athos took his sons horse	265.5809

Provisions began to fail and	1744.2249
In one of these risings	833.2019
Athos and Aramis left Paris	494.1706
They quitted Paris beholding it	2251.2935
Parisians and Frondeurs as they	861.6159

His noble nature felt that	194.6557

Do not let us despond	484.5113
But what ails you <PAD>	9.3252

I know no better means	59.6922
I shall seek not Mazarin	564.1588
Tis a last resource but	1609.1202

The conference being finished the	82.9493

As to what may lie	337.1806
I dont believe that Monsieur	2031.3735

No I am sorry to	232.6503

A prisoner he reiterated <PAD>	10.9273

Suddenly DArtagnan looked up and	799.2783
Come come said Comminges who	579.5930
Laugh at the chance which	525.2756
And how did he look	835.7374
Very well indeed sir replied	683.8983

It is then the cardinals	100.8563
Every evening he shuts himself	21.9884

Besides according to all probability	840.3889
Let the cardinal take care	594.2953
Oh oh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0550

Listen my dear friend in	42.4347

Now said DArtagnan I am	86.4472
Dont lose a word of	76.8131
Everything lies in the execution	451.2717
I depend on you <PAD>	8.7905
Look I shall turn to	480.3231

Suppose I happen to strangle	717.4824
Lay him down here well	203.4009
So we shall get from	838.3485
Pooh replied DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	6.4303
Yes said Porthos recollecting himself	1465.7971
Therefore when I cough stretch	1861.2963
Goodevening comrade said DArtagnan in	72.1420
Goodevening sir answered the soldier	61.0894
Tis not too warm to	32.7518

A bottle perhaps A whole	26.0073
Yes sir A whole bottle	319.8327

With all my heart <PAD>	8.2154
How convenient that theres a	30.2328

He raised him almost stifling	796.2605
He then laid him down	1408.9054
Then the soldier gagged and	1014.0313
Heres a sword and a	19.7657
I take them said DArtagnan	17.1515
If you want another uniform	234.9500
Stop <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8438
I see the other soldier	1105.6195
No I will go down	845.6630
Be ready said Porthos as	44.0878
He did as he said	8.6334
Porthos seized his opportunity caught	1489.2919
Then they undressed him as	838.7867
This operation proved as great	53.8148
There said DArtagnan this is	13.4488
Now let me try on	58.3696
Porthos I doubt if you	1163.1582
They then dressed themselves <PAD>	10.3852
Tis done they both exclaimed	22.7178
As to you comrades they	414.2380
Now said DArtagnan you wouldnt	774.8921
Do you think Athos will	137.7142
I understand Wait a little	1010.8315
What is to happen said	12.6826
Follow me replied DArtagnan <PAD>	7.8444
The man who lives to	434.2059

These two newly enlisted soldiers	2139.3906
Do you hearnot a single	21.2428
Obey that person implicitly <PAD>	11.1704
On your return you can	29.3157
You have only to wait	747.1089
The Gascon therefore instead of	80.1736
Ja in the most German	65.6972
As for Porthos on whom	849.4891
All that he was allowed	336.4659
Bernouin shut the door and	18.0890
When Porthos heard the key	940.5664
Porthos my friend said DArtagnan	34.4618
Let me meditate and consider	946.7327
We have walked eight paces	1899.9321
The Comte de la Fere	1396.8185
Have you not heard that	614.4313
That might do if we	1373.3169

Porthos effaced himself against the	633.2962

Tedesco answered the cavalier va	1136.9052
Now asked Porthos what are	775.5209
Everything in its proper time	349.3550
But first barricade the first	1601.5375

As I told you everything	2258.2939
They entered behind a glass	641.8585
No cardinal said DArtagnan but	842.4572
Ten men would have found	1947.4720
DArtagnan as we have said	594.8104
He called Porthos to look	16.5651
Were our object money only	693.9556
At the bottom of that	1894.2322
So I think and therefore	821.4304
At the same moment whilst	917.9287
Mazarin had left his lamp	487.5752
Faith he said in Italian	1119.9497
I am a great captainthat	21.0648

The cardinal reached a second	1488.2200
He then turned to the	386.5649
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
Diavolo he exclaimed I forgot	761.0535
Do not give yourself the	727.5416
And he made the same	36.9473
Mazarin gazed at each of	1680.2891
DArtagnan picked it up by	102.9140
Oh what imprudence my lord	377.5062
Your eminence might knock against	2632.3389
Yes my lord it is	402.6913
You were going to visit	59.5289
Dont let us disarrange your	21.5637
Be so good as to	799.6091
Have you been long in	718.7573
Porthos opened his mouth to	573.9222
This moment come my lord	17.5192
Mazarin breathed again <PAD> <PAD>	8.2462
His fears were now no	90.4238
A sort of smile played	30.6914
Come he said you have	30.0476
I confess myself conquered <PAD>	12.9507
You wish to ask for	797.0753
Certainly and on the other	425.3643
His piercing look was fixed	746.1227
Both were in shadow and	208.6389
To purchase back my liberty	27.7102
Yes my lord And how	713.0867
We must ask the Comte	47.4937
Will your eminence deign to	680.6527
My lord said DArtagnan your	1040.9856
Conferences <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8498
Mazarin turned the lock of	743.8113
On perceiving Mazarin he bowed	13.7248
Your eminence he said might	781.9396
DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8484
Porthos he exclaimed <PAD> <PAD>	6.1973
My very self dear friend	68.5189
What means this asked the	12.7684
It means replied Mazarin trying	1017.3392
my lord cried the Gascon	26.2526
tis a bad example <PAD>	10.1176
We are so good and	31.0475
Come let us put aside	786.5779
But dont think yourselves in	65.3900
In ensnaring me you have	70.5439
How are you to get	21.1012
remember the soldiers and sentinels	41.7905
Now I am going to	1204.7157
Before an hour has passed	925.4255
And like every other reflection	1671.2141
And therefore said DArtagnan to	1795.7814
You do not believe me	783.3170
Hem replied DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	6.4275
I have heard speak of	359.5658
I fear he may have	762.7214
that is another thing said	14.2062
Let us see said Athos	10.2274
Let us see said DArtagnan	9.9846
In the first place do	34.9710
Unfold your plan my lord	1262.1671
Listen he said at the	445.6900
Go and take this key	133.9269
At a hundred steps on	461.7945
by Jove my lord said	136.5858
Where is the key you	74.0198
You will conduct us yourself	1050.8519
It led into the park	1380.5148
The devil exclaimed the Gascon	76.1046
We dont know the locality	60.1554
Since your eminence has come	1211.7278
Are you satisfied gentlemen asked	17.2462
I think so indeed we	122.9638
Deuce take it <PAD> <PAD>	6.2255
three poor gentlemen escorted by	49.6548
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
apropos my lord <PAD> <PAD>	6.3832
you remarked that we were	224.2279
Monsieur du Vallon and I	61.1336
The count is not and	1283.6833
My lord said DArtagnan will	679.7394
Well well cried DArtagnan this	992.5247
Athos assisted by Porthos who	250.1626
Now jump down Athos Athos	181.5878
Are you on the ground	14.7687
Yes Without accident Perfectly safe	403.1134
No I dont want your	137.2641
Well You are right it	55.5842
Lend me your backbut dont	938.9013
Mazarin pretended to laugh <PAD>	10.3543
Are you there asked Porthos	10.1838
Yes my friend and now	32.4148
Now give me the cardinal	1043.5884
jump directly down close to	1190.3704
You are free he said	1445.3108
Porthos next made an effort	1118.2069
I didnt understand it all	348.4197
so much the better but	764.5092
Porthos did the same <PAD>	7.4648
Attend to monsieur le cardinal	1281.3754
My lord he said which	26.8512
Think well of your reply	1393.8105
The cardinal could not keep	148.7384
Suddenly DArtagnan touched something warm	30.6192
Stop <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8438
a horse he cried I	104.6227
I too said Porthos who	144.5520
Theres luck my lord <PAD>	10.5125
just as you were complaining	905.0115
what art thou about <PAD>	12.0753
Why thou art posted here	1596.8477
Aramis here cried Athos <PAD>	8.8123
At the lesser gate of	2654.2410
There was no one in	222.7312
Chapter LXXXVII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.7211
Thinking that Porthos will be	72.0881
At the expiration of ten	389.2061
He was excessively delighted and	78.3321
You are free my brothers	13.6790
free without my aid <PAD>	9.4818
and I shall have succeeded	747.8730
I had well concerted my	1823.6051
Thus I was able thanks	1156.4989
But said DArtagnan I trust	1165.1249
In one of the despatches	580.1252
In the other he announces	837.0184
You can understand dear friend	169.4814
I placed myself in ambuscade	1384.4734
You are free tonight without	59.5728
How did you manage to	41.5185
You must have much reason	126.8594
Really I might even say	874.3447
Then he offered us our	49.2726
He even went so far	704.3792
Ho <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8429

Apropos <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8474

Yes but I am expecting	164.6515
And here he comes by	19.0206
galloping through the bushes The	16.5414

Raoul <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8462
Raoul he ejaculated <PAD> <PAD>	7.4226
For one moment the young	405.4555
Look my lord cardinal said	683.6837
Gentlemen he continued addressing the	1349.6011
He will indeed give us	572.9807
Come said DArtagnan after a	1443.1986
To your house dear Porthos	1860.9280
Come my lord you shall	735.7288
The chances of war said	1324.0675
The rest of the night	713.1799
Mazarin still sombre and pensive	1384.9634
At dawn twelve leagues had	2261.7563
Horses nowadays are not what	1336.6997
He is to bring us	170.0645
We at least must keep	415.0051
Once beyond Saint Denis we	558.8278
The nobleman to whom he	775.9688
Ten minutes later the escort	2662.5452
At noon they rode into	55.1602
Ah said Mousqueton who had	632.4527
We are four of us	922.3953
Athos is going to examine	1155.8820
That is to say Athos	1543.2284
Gentlemen he said when he	386.8669
Were the late Cardinal Richelieu	1578.6624
Tomorrow the army of Paris	113.6832
The field of battle instead	2579.8337
We will not expose your	900.5681
as to conditions you would	1967.3835
friends Well then tell me	494.5834
Speak Comte de la Fere	279.1138
For France were I to	96.8542
I beg you to excuse	1251.7943
Speak then chevalier said the	14.2536
What do you want <PAD>	7.9777
Nothing ambiguous if you please	14.7081
Be clear short and precise	895.6141
Let us consider first the	28.5626
The demands in that programme	1580.1558
I do not suppose that	946.3058
My lord you are right	292.4843
The count has a mind	139.1417
He is a proud soulhe	41.3362
You are righthe is worth	916.2106
You are right it is	843.8370
I require that his majesty	893.9791
And you sir he said	8.2863
I my lord answered the	1046.9203
Far from wishing my lord	1146.1718
I shall try also to	1416.7782
And you Monsieur du Vallon	26.7063
Speak if you please said	13.5755
As for me answered Porthos	571.9420
Besides should it be necessary	1759.4707
If I stay in Paris	668.1109
You remain minister that is	846.5295
His eminence will continue to	1073.0415
Ho <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8429

The Frondeurs will have a	1010.6180
I can not answer for	15.6331
Suppose her majesty refuses Oh	2423.5085
Will your eminence please read	1799.5376
How they must be asking	1189.6134
What comments must be made	1679.2950
Sign the treaty then monseigneur	22.4213
Suppose the queen should refuse	39.3579
nonsense cried DArtagnan I can	977.5923
When I see her majesty	1041.9783
Sign my lord and he	26.2081
Mazarin arose walked some moments	67.4344
And when I have signed	481.3324
Mazarin started turned toward the	1311.7291
It is sufficient count he	40.3818
And now Monsieur dArtagnan he	646.0002
Shows how with Threat and	173.8927
DArtagnan knew his part well	649.8793
He soon arranged a prompt	1685.9906
But before setting out he	1194.9417
In fact he said as	730.1022
What will come out of	396.8965
The deliverance of the cardinal	15.4844
Now the deliverance of the	654.0416
You my dear Chevalier dHerblay	82.1723
Mistrust Athos therefore who will	166.8765
Mistrust Porthos especially who to	1410.9990
Fear nothing he said I	38.6588
My private ambition tends only	1156.7521
Friend he said you have	713.2972
What should you say if	648.7717
and you would be right	532.7125
There is no question you	1785.9746
I shall see you through	566.8283
I shall see everything and	1371.1105
My dear Athos he said	26.7543
I have only one thing	21.4810
You know Anne of Austria	846.0018
I give you my word	710.1759
Now that I have the	648.7940
Six hours after he left	72.2199
The disappearance of Mazarin was	53.4199
Anne of Austria was informed	119.5533
In the chamber of DArtagnan	181.0436
On recovering the use of	1338.2571
But as to what had	558.8547
Bernouin alone knew a little	32.1959
Bernouin seeing that his master	858.7787
The first door barricaded with	1710.4054
Then he came to the	442.9180
From the latter point it	116.1812
He saw that these tracks	1945.3726
He could no longer cherish	1005.9380
Anne had enforced the utmost	1303.2072
Now since DArtagnan did not	794.0466
On entering the courtyard of	1371.8567
At the sight of DArtagnan	864.0524
But DArtagnan made a friendly	775.6226
Monsieur dArtagnan cried the latter	1198.2396
He felt the need of	1516.6421
We were too devoted servants	109.6123
We set out last evening	1058.8157
And therefore my dear Monsieur	764.5547
DArtagnan approached the sovereign with	1306.1449
The queen read it recognized	700.7651
DArtagnan related everything with that	513.7937
The queen as he went	72.1398
She could not comprehend how	1277.1359
How sir she cried as	934.3013
There is here no question	40.2881
Monsieur de Mazarin held us	949.0374
We were then convinced my	433.6898
Now that an explanation may	1815.5084
We have therefore taken away	777.6027
Well madame it proved to	112.8991
Monsieur de Mazarin had thought	1054.9009
We were able to prove	821.5722
That proof satisfied him so	908.2283
In fact I have rarely	1692.0382
I am so little mistaken	708.2287
Before he could be possibly	596.6196
And therefore my friends will	1769.8795
These gentlemen wage war on	2964.4922
He will be delivered to	847.7208
Believe me madame as true	1145.8586
Have you then madame no	1333.6793
Look at me madameat me	161.0970
What am I <PAD> <PAD>	5.7848
A poor officer without fortune	1207.7037
Look at the Comte de	286.4025
He has taken part against	103.7428
He has not been unreasonably	56.1857
Look at Monsieur du Vallon	1297.7626
Consider in short your people	837.4363
Why did you not say	95.8338
Because madame it was necessary	756.6996
In doing us justice you	327.6609
You will see in me	1353.8545
I do not see here	718.3132
We do not think ourselves	1604.5950
Speak He who has negotiated	1319.2885
Undoubtedly madame said DArtagnan taking	1104.3475
A hundred thousand francs for	1667.6112
To think of the Parisians	1455.4287
Now then she said what	681.1352
Nay it must have been	1683.6230
But I am sure of	889.1917
Now there remains the chevalier	1490.3091
Monsieur de Longueville is of	48.8196
Yes said the queen but	667.6004
The Comte de la Fere	917.9646
Well we will reflect and	44.0160
Are you satisfied sir There	1687.0972
I will sign it tomorrow	765.8969
Consent then I beg you	849.1534
DArtagnan started on seeing these	19.8803
Since that period of history	147.0013
The Gascon shook his head	151.8129
Madame he said kneeling look	75.1282
He begs you to believe	295.6746
He has faith in himself	571.4429
And in proof that he	746.6609
Behold madame <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.3362
here are the august signatures	692.9207
There are momentsfor if everything	861.7211
DArtagnan when he gave way	936.2747
He was therefore instantly recompensed	1018.3890
You were right sir said	15.8924
I misunderstood you <PAD> <PAD>	7.9551
There are the acts signed	97.7645
Go and bring me back	1443.1277
Madame said DArtagnan rising I	462.7977
I never rightly understood those	1022.1345
On the same day the	689.1133
Here is what each of	1732.6147
Moreover something had been said	66.3956
The idea was welcomed by	664.3758
The Duc de Beaufort made	1635.8770
Full pardon was accorded to	87.7759
He received also the office	1298.3196
The Duc de Bouillon received	1321.3611
The Duc de Longueville gained	1382.4126
Aramis stipulated that Bazin should	1489.5731
The Duc dElbeuf obtained payment	3126.4314
The coadjutor alone obtained nothing	16.1075
They promised indeed to negotiate	1378.8766
Quite contrary to the lot	626.8667
And therefore when all Paris	890.7112
Those two men were the	137.5577
They came with their usual	270.3276
Chapter LXXXIX <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.6691
Difficult for Kings to return	68.6932
Whilst DArtagnan and Porthos were	477.0345
Each had his own particular	26.3223
Aramis rushed to the Hotel	173.1322
The duchess loudly lamented the	54.5515
War had made her a	56.2181
She declared that she would	309.0518
But when Aramis had presented	865.9312
Aramis made a presence of	823.7430
Madame he said you have	582.3828
You have succeeded the prince	121.3491
Now attach him to our	18.2899
Withdraw him gently from the	239.6786
The Fronde is a comedy	110.6491
Let us wait for a	684.0949
This Frondist duchess trusted so	1763.5916
Athos on quitting Aramis went	42.9525
Here was another frondeuse to	788.9658
There had been no stipulation	29.9217
Monsieur de Chevreuse had not	1003.6503
At the first announcement of	968.9621
My fair friend said Athos	227.4111
You will get yourself exiled	146.7501
Believe me we have passed	822.0142
Alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8417
excuse my weakness <PAD> <PAD>	7.5441
There are moments when a	1382.5491
Count she said you are	53.1511
I suppose you have a	945.9038
Athos took her hand and	18.7623
She sighed as she looked	19.0121
Count she said Bragelonne must	35.3932
You are a man of	12.5531
You have waterwoodsflowers there She	3233.2668
Madame exclaimed Athos what were	96.7645
Never have I seen you	196.1677
Does Monsieur de Bragelonne remain	43.7263
What think you of it	15.5012
Leave him with me replied	15.3230
No madame if you have	919.3046
No I shall go incognito	1805.9512
he is quite a child	194.7168
You are right duchess <PAD>	10.1714
This singular passion for a	254.7124
There is to be war	19.0305
He shall go thither And	106.0992
I will arm him against	3534.8879
The next day in fact	323.9475
Meanwhile the queen every hour	41.7451
I hear she said that	31.3953
I am afraid for the	1265.5552
Sir said Mazarin to him	65.7892
I shall be on the	614.7318

The queen had confidence in	362.7649
The royal procession set out	28.7686
Guitant and Comminges at the	636.9057

The cortege proceeded to Notre	255.5567
All Paris were in the	13.4253

When the procession reached the	372.6835
Mazarin leaned out of the	14.0826
One or two shouts of	3011.8999
Mazarin turned pale and shrank	41.6209
Lowborn fellows ejaculated Porthos <PAD>	13.5524
DArtagnan said nothing but twirled	1586.2299
Anne of Austria bent down	1645.7955
I have not said goodmorning	166.5093
It was you who were	714.2621
brave as you are and	717.1031
The queen and her minister	149.7038
The crowd whilst preserving an	1231.2212
Reports were whispered about like	2721.9866
DArtagnan turned toward the musketeers	1247.7747
The ranks closed firmly in	359.0465
At the Barriere des Sergents	100.6848
Comminges left the head of	60.8682
Anne questioned DArtagnan by a	15.2378
He answered in the same	14.2792
Proceed she said <PAD> <PAD>	5.9034
Comminges returned to his post	10.6257
An effort was made and	103.8300
Some complaints arose from the	373.8447
Onward cried DArtagnan in a	18.4510
Onward cried Porthos <PAD> <PAD>	6.7072
But as if the multitude	1137.9248
Cries of Down with Mazarin	138.1676
At the same time through	2069.6597
This new eruption was more	259.0353
It was plain that it	705.2560
Each of these mobs was	553.2087
Both were evidently stimulated by	38.1453
There was a shock which	67.5342
Myriads of hoarse cries forming	525.9338
Ho <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8429
Musketeers cried DArtagnan <PAD> <PAD>	6.4932
The escort divided into two	27.5028
One of them passed around	81.0811
One went to support DArtagnan	22.7618
Then came a skirmish the	1318.5602
Like all popular movements the	311.5955
The musketeers few in number	1410.7037
DArtagnan offered to lower the	1001.3672
I wish to see everything	355.5201
And turning with that fury	861.3497
Make room cried DArtagnan <PAD>	8.8056
Zounds <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8524
give way At these words	570.0101
The blow was sped by	130.5381
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
confound it cried the Gascon	179.1965
What the devil are you	580.7502
I have already got up	1506.3622

Well said Danglars did you	93.0419
Did he allude to his	942.6727
And is he still in	1080.0280

Rest content with my friendship	576.3248
Well Mercds beloved by you	1009.5348

Would not that dress please	679.7679
I do not understand you	809.6819
Fernand you are wicked to	165.7128
Yes I will not deny	371.4824
I understand you Fernand you	828.5854
What end would that answer	11.6906
To lose you my friendship	1055.2682
Believe me to seek a	765.0818
No Fernand you will not	69.3161
Unable to have me for	545.1301
He arose paced a while	1392.0258
Edmond and Mercds were clasped	42.3534
The burning Marseilles sun which	1062.0649
At first they saw nothing	21.2251
Their intense happiness isolated them	950.1096
Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy	434.2682
By a movement for which	646.2319
Ah your pardon said Dants	878.7233
Do you not remember him	849.6058
But Fernand instead of responding	221.4333
Edmond then cast his eyes	1216.3734
This look told him all	70.1020
I did not know when	574.1266
An enemy in my house	30.4886
If I believed that I	555.4573
And should any misfortune occur	848.5523
But you are deceived Edmond	20.7808
You have no enemy herethere	1213.4160
His hatred like a powerless	1850.4829
Scarcely however had he touched	858.2326

Wretchedwretched that I am Hallo	19.7646
Hallo Fernand <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5584

The young man stopped suddenly	877.2714
Well said Caderousse why dont	19.9226
Are you really in such	378.9799
Fernand looked at them both	157.3600
He seems besotted said Danglars	80.8130

Goodday said he <PAD> <PAD>	5.3916
You called me didnt you	969.9203

Why when a man has	660.6588

You are laughing at him	186.7883
Come come Fernand said Caderousse	87.6353
Its not polite not to	1208.1311
Ah you see Danglars said	592.3259
Poor Fernand has been dismissed	28.7739
Well and what then said	857.8411
Is she not free to	685.8744
But I thought you were	500.8763
It was even told me	359.9746
A lover is never terrible	19.8415
Poor fellow remarked Danglars affecting	235.7344
Why you see he did	1473.5436
These things always come on	2572.8987
Never mindin the meantime he	3523.1960

Do you know them Fernand	15.1368
Yes was the reply in	19.8210
It is Edmond and Mercds	226.6169
Hallo Dants <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.1815

See look at Fernand and	2159.9683
At this Fernand recollected her	911.1558
Danglars looked at the two	624.5216
I shall get nothing from	1357.5917
Heres an envious fellow making	1705.7035
Yet this Catalan has eyes	2301.9531
Unquestionably Edmonds star is in	1280.1637

Well my dear sir said	914.8149
Do you then love Mercds	1786.4464
How do I know <PAD>	7.3542
Is it my affair <PAD>	8.3129

Women say those things but	1520.0405
Thats love or I dont	721.1628
Drink then and do not	2293.4873
I could drink four more	446.8459

This drunken Caderousse has made	1358.2515
You talk like a noodle	1304.2815
Prove it Danglars <PAD> <PAD>	6.1547
I have answered for you	9.2351

Absence severs as well as	773.8604
And why I should like	206.0294
he has neither robbed nor	309.4084
I wont hold my tongue	1052.0918
Danglars saw in the muddled	899.5496
Have you that means It	52.8449
But why should I meddle	25.3499
it is no affair of	783.5109
motives of hatred against Dants	12.8089
None on my word <PAD>	8.0126
I saw you were unhappy	1062.0112
No no said Fernand restraining	25.9385
It is of very little	575.7666
I hate him <PAD> <PAD>	7.3583
I confess it openly <PAD>	11.5456
Do you find the means	611.6018

When one thinks said Caderousse	1236.6991
I have always had more	705.7751
Give him some more wine	2026.5623
The Catalan watched him until	3543.4102
Well resumed the Catalan as	1342.7245
Well then I should say	834.5928
Yes but they will make	858.8975
But Dants can not remain	582.6180
Mercds who will detest you	1393.3254
No no continued Danglars if	747.4766
Proof of this crime will	507.6909
Yes and thats all settled	845.3320
Yes and thats all settled	834.1874
Yes said Danglars taking it	593.9012
All right said Caderousse <PAD>	8.7945
Dants is my friend and	380.4328
Certainly neither I nor Fernand	1027.5903
In this case replied Caderousse	62.6775
I wish to drink to	847.7766
Why Ill wager I can	2491.4854
Give me your arm and	911.5765
Come Fernand wont you return	972.5518

Well just as you like	94.0862
Come along Danglars and let	1493.0974
When they had advanced about	2694.2078
Well said Caderousse why what	34.4851
He said he was going	71.3472
Hallo Fernand <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5584
You are coming my boy	1259.1825
The Marriage Feast The mornings	6368.6929
The feast had been made	2112.3970
The apartment destined for the	1139.7484
And although the entertainment was	1332.8147
Various rumors were afloat to	1547.0944
Danglars however who now made	2273.6943
In fact a moment later	1291.7732
With the entrance of M	634.2170
Danglars and Caderousse set off	1815.1024
Neither Mercds nor Edmond observed	1046.7435
Having acquitted themselves of their	1509.6584
The old man was attired	3948.6270
His thin but wiry legs	7462.7397
Thus he came along supporting	3628.2458
Beside him glided Caderousse whose	1465.5797
As Danglars approached the disappointed	1619.4596
Dants himself was simply but	2542.2046
Lovely as the Greek girls	4365.0249
She moved with the light	164.5286
One more practiced in the	2033.5687
Edmond at the approach of	956.5164
Father said Mercds stopping when	823.2518
During this time Dants at	1338.0817
M Morrel was seated at	567.2349
Then they began to pass	6812.4922
All the delicacies in fact	1486.2775
Now would anybody think that	1998.2510
Why what ails you asked	23.0629
Do you fear any approaching	20.4642
I should say that you	723.7703
Man does not appear to	1770.9644
I own that I am	1116.2948
Mercds is not yet your	13.7269
Just assume the tone and	548.2178
Well never mind that neighbor	599.8170
Tis true that Mercds is	758.3138
Mercds looked pleased and gratified	758.3250
In an hour inquired Danglars	25.9187
How is that my friend	46.0848
Thanks to the influence of	995.3594
We have purchased permission to	1593.2456
Now as a quarterpast one	927.3753
Upon my word cried the	184.0011
Arrived here only yesterday morning	80.6633
Commend me to a sailor	835.3943
Mercds has no fortune I	54.9320
So you see our papers	2585.3335
So that what we presumed	1818.1698
No no answered Dants dont	363.9879
Tomorrow morning I start for	544.4118
I shall be back here	947.6161
Dants perceiving the affectionate eagerness	1706.5845
Around the table reigned that	2903.1089
Such as at the commencement	1361.6859
Everybody talked at once without	981.2487
Fernands paleness appeared to have	43.8989
As for Fernand himself he	742.7845
Caderousse approached him just as	864.1921
Upon my word said Caderousse	1028.2103
I can not help thinking	992.7054
Certainly continued Danglars the sacrifice	330.2426
Upon my soul that future	109.3608
Gad <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8452
I only wish he would	1154.0580
At this moment Danglars who	1939.7667
At the same instant his	1342.7910
The sounds drew nearer <PAD>	13.6123
Three blows were struck upon	45.2568
The company looked at each	36.6273
I demand admittance said a	1050.5693
Uneasiness now yielded to the	147.9076
May I venture to inquire	1086.8660
Who among the persons here	1121.4866
He saw before him an	1394.7452
Old Dants however sprang forward	16.4844
There are situations which the	235.8726
He prayed and supplicated in	1292.4633
Your son has probably neglected	2343.9795
How can I tell you	537.5394
The scene of the previous	243.9305
The painful catastrophe he had	1616.3088
So so said he in	392.7340
All I can say is	1153.7185
How do I know replied	908.2534
Never mind where he is	404.6834
A carriage awaited him at	719.1632
Adieu adieu dearest Edmond cried	326.8886
The prisoner heard the cry	949.0098
Wait for me here all	473.2402
The old father and Mercds	1570.1670
Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance	1372.3552
Instinctively Fernand drew back his	19.0168
He is the cause of	779.9128
I dont think so answered	301.2634
I only hope the mischief	1988.1517
Surely answered Danglars one can	1846.4989
What think you Danglars said	507.0551
I know she was loaded	1746.6802
Now the mischief is out	1673.9210
Her grief which she had	1416.9323
Come come said the old	590.7396
Hope faintly murmured Fernand but	1910.3756
Good news <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.7134
good news shouted forth one	260.2614
Here comes M Morrel back	13.6966
No doubt now we shall	994.2010
He was very pale <PAD>	8.4918
What news exclaimed a general	36.9487
Alas my friends replied M	1069.7050
That I believe answered M	380.4034
With being an agent of	2555.3997
A despairing cry escaped the	345.1081
Ah Danglars whispered Caderousse you	1388.3308
I am determined to tell	1303.6050
Who can tell whether Dants	52.2583
The vessel did touch at	430.2368
Now should any letters or	1073.4484
Suppose we wait a while	549.2003
To be sure answered Danglars	12.5996
Let us wait by all	16.2025
If he be innocent of	1426.3400
I can not stay here	1044.8774
Let us take ourselves out	958.9972
The rumor of Edmonds arrest	853.6573
Could you ever have credited	704.0068
Could you have believed such	703.5604
Then added in a low	1382.3519
I should have feared to	793.9232
I am too well aware	1786.4924
You are a worthy fellow	683.0864
Poor Dants said Caderousse <PAD>	8.5537
No one can deny his	1322.6577
You know that I am	673.0726
I fully authorize you at	854.7897
Private misfortunes must never be	1606.2057
I am aware he is	606.7509
But now hasten on board	2245.1924
You see said Danglars addressing	62.6366
Do you still feel any	988.9706
neither you nor myself but	729.9058
I only wish I could	842.9125
And now I think of	133.5747
Fortunately for me the handwriting	835.8123
As I before said I	99.4767
It seems however that I	2056.6658
You will see Danglars that	464.9756
If any harm come of	367.7583
How can we be implicated	30.2542
All we have got to	1022.5791
So far then said Danglars	120.0321
I am temporarily commander of	1188.9772
My only fear is the	49.9030
But there he is in	511.2454
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Deputy Procureur du Roi	6738.7002
In this case however although	521.7452
Instead of a rude mixture	1548.3505
The guests were still at	1872.1674
The emperor now king of	3018.7727
The magistrates freely discussed their	4780.8198
It was not over the	632.2028
An old man decorated with	1239.7883
It was the Marquis de	14.7431

But therenow take himhe is	122.0799
M Villefort I beg to	958.1301
Never mind Rene replied the	1730.6925
I forgive you <PAD> <PAD>	6.9064
What I was saying Villefort	1460.2147
Napoleon is the Mahomet of	1423.0614
For mercys sake then what	61.5659
Come come do not strip	810.5367
The only difference consists in	1566.9269
Observe said Villefort smiling I	1198.1687
Still marquise it has been	1032.2843
But I excuse it it	791.4738
Tis true madame answered he	556.8074
What avails recrimination over matters	90.1753
For my own part I	1166.1110
He wasnay probably may still	2345.5000
Let what may remain of	2849.6604
Come now I have hopes	1127.9120
I promise you it affords	221.6110
All I ask is that	376.3315
Remember also Villefort that we	1151.7062
But bear in mind that	1161.5470
I have already successfully conducted	653.9275
But we have not done	258.5178
I am at least fearful	17.9952
Napoleon in the Island of	864.5210
Marseilles is filled with halfpay	3720.4238
An island situated on the	783.9197
So much the better <PAD>	7.9744
As Villefort observes it is	850.1484
There wasnt any trouble over	2326.7590
The king is either a	1031.2074
I never was in a	1273.7083
The prisoner whom you there	1455.1178
I leave you to judge	577.5977
Of this however be assured	1336.7858
Tis like a duel <PAD>	9.3009
I have already recorded sentence	2287.3362
Suppose for instance the prisoner	1198.4750
Besides one requires the excitement	1296.5106
I would not choose to	694.7794
No my pride is to	973.8795
Bravo cried one of the	758.0850
What a splendid business that	882.6910
Upon my word you killed	889.8075
Nowadays the military profession is	335.8154
There is a wise Latin	1837.8623
I can not speak Latin	39.3385
Well said Rene I can	2248.2212
Do you know I always	1604.6256
Let us hope my child	1075.6700
Madame replied Villefort with a	746.8485
Do you know my dear	580.9158
Then the king who without	1514.4011
I should myself have recommended	1357.9438

I love to see you	13.3037
Now then were a conspirator	1475.0522
If you wish to see	875.8553
Villefort immediately rose from table	1408.9128
Rene regarded him with fond	1683.4094
You were wishing just now	379.3468
Well I at least resemble	945.8971
For a very serious matter	1722.9680

Why if my information prove	2844.8149

Already rich he held a	132.6049
He was about to marry	1306.7429
The dowry of his wife	1594.4236
These considerations naturally gave Villefort	2219.1643
At the door he met	92.6085
The sight of this officer	934.9992
The prisoner himself is named	3546.0200
Ah M de Villefort cried	51.5561
Some of your people have	1434.9449
He is the most estimable	647.2262
Oh M de Villefort I	957.1561
Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel	1461.2324
Is it not true The	1155.3381
Morrel reddened for his own	1305.4462
He replied however in a	717.4982
Ah ah murmured he is	2808.4880
He was if I recollect	935.8565
The antechamber was full of	1506.4176
Villefort traversed the antechamber cast	1672.8295
He had recognized intelligence in	1227.7241
Villeforts first impression was favorable	1858.0729
He stifled therefore the feelings	1933.3075
An instant after Dants entered	13.7726
He was pale but calm	1306.4208
It was then that he	1034.8008
Who and what are you	977.9205
My name is Edmond Dants	1426.3148
Nineteen returned Dants <PAD> <PAD>	7.0453
What were you doing at	424.0039
You were at the festival	218.1300
Yes monsieur I am on	643.1953

When this speech was arranged	36.8691
Go on sir said he	8.7352

My political opinions replied Dants	17.5843
Alas sir I never had	21.5377

Pardieu said Villefort he is	20.5135

You seem a worthy young	1086.5659
Here is the paper do	628.0563
Dants read it <PAD> <PAD>	6.5667
A cloud passed over his	575.7521
Whoever did it writes well	13.8666
I am very fortunate added	773.1294
Now said the deputy answer	535.5321
None at all <PAD> <PAD>	5.9271
I will tell you the	21.0260
I swear by my honor	816.9480
Then internally If Rene could	1606.2869
As we had no doctor	680.9374
My dear Dants said he	428.1745
Well as after my death	1103.4790
You will accomplish what I	522.9751
At these words he gave	25.4091
It was timetwo hours after	888.7203
Everywhere the last requests of	817.9833
I sailed for the Island	1023.7051
As I had expected I	843.3515
He questioned me concerning Captain	1167.7574
I undertook it because it	104.0097
I landed here regulated the	1902.0931

Give up this letter you	704.0991
I am free then sir	34.9622
Yes but first give me	555.2349
To whom is it addressed	2146.7412
He sank into his seat	1517.2135

Noirtier Rue CoqHron No <PAD>	12.8843
murmured he growing still paler	15.7693
Yes said Dants do you	778.3394
I have however already told	579.0477
I was forced to read	621.9406
To no one on my	563.7411
Villeforts brow darkened more and	604.5857
After reading the letter Villefort	56.0932
Oh said Dants timidly what	656.6797
And you say that you	407.4312
You are illshall I ring	793.1017
It is for me to	684.4209
Attend to yourself answer me	122.9740
Villefort fell back on his	1085.3558
Oh if he knows the	375.3580
Oh it is impossible to	35.5327
In heavens name cried the	653.9415
The principal charge against you	846.0437
You see I destroy it	1217.1207
Should anyone else interrogate you	532.2455
You see continued he glancing	2186.2935
A police agent entered <PAD>	12.4494
Villefort whispered some words in	289.9418
Follow him said Villefort to	11.3153
Dants saluted Villefort and retired	13.8822
Hardly had the door closed	127.1293
Alas alas murmured he if	302.2088
This accursed letter would have	49.8450
Oh my father must your	1945.3364

The Palais de Justice communicated	3025.5515
After numberless windings Dants saw	118.3049
The commissary took up an	2434.0244
The door opened the two	893.7434
The air he inhaled was	292.4303
He was conducted to a	2282.6609
It was four oclock when	54.4162
It was as we have	171.1636
The obscurity augmented the acuteness	1137.3683
At last about ten oclock	1004.3205
By the torchlight Dants saw	204.4506
He had advanced at first	144.1279
Are you come to fetch	19.8582
Yes replied a gendarme <PAD>	9.0879
By the orders of the	889.4253
A carriage waited at the	444.1976
Is this carriage for me	15.8513
It is for you replied	15.4090
Dants was about to speak	1111.1028
The prisoner glanced at the	1325.8927
Through the grating however Dants	1091.2531
Soon he saw the lights	31.0219
The carriage stopped the officer	1635.6125
Can all this force be	60.0400
The officer opened the door	739.8579
The two gendarmes who were	833.2703
They advanced towards a boat	375.4796
The soldiers looked at Dants	79.6764
In an instant he was	770.6766
At a shout from the	706.8613
The prisoners first feeling was	1851.6418
Dants folded his hands raised	123.3909
The boat continued her voyage	15.7277
They had passed the Tte	1538.7609
This manuvre was incomprehensible to	19.4090
Whither are you taking me	15.1517
You will soon know But	1817.1877
The most vague and wild	71.3411
The boat they were in	1136.2018
He was not bound nor	571.8768
Besides had not the deputy	482.4691
Had not Villefort in his	179.0622
He waited silently striving to	62.6449
They had left the Ile	1850.0039
It seemed to the prisoner	982.3437
How was it that a	809.8051
One light alone was visible	148.3080
Mercds was the only one	40.5396
A loud cry could be	29.1306
But pride restrained him and	46.5386
What would his guards think	127.9283
He remained silent his eyes	588.8940
An intervening elevation of land	54.8912
Dants turned and perceived that	52.5059
While he had been absorbed	1597.5979
In spite of his repugnance	1095.7999
I am Captain Dants a	1579.9938
Tell me I entreat But	1156.6655
You see I can not	1285.4768

I am not going there	310.8407
I have committed no crime	13.6091
Are there any magistrates or	2066.9111
Come come do not look	554.1861
You think then said he	683.5967
But what are you doing	10.4476
Help comrades help By a	3598.9946

Good said the gendarme placing	742.4343
Believe softspoken gentlemen again <PAD>	12.6864
Hark ye my friend I	897.0511
For a moment the idea	980.8608
But he bethought him of	748.9894
He remained motionless but gnashing	202.4107
At this moment the boat	100.9880
One of the sailors leaped	1585.1593
His guards taking him by	1215.2117
Dants made no resistance he	740.0778
He did not even see	1210.4683
They halted for a minute	156.2275
He looked around he was	1017.8088
They waited upwards of ten	22.0857
Certain Dants could not escape	42.0450
They seemed awaiting orders <PAD>	11.9914
The orders came <PAD> <PAD>	7.5919
Where is the prisoner said	13.7578
Here replied the gendarmes <PAD>	8.5421
Let him follow me I	458.3496
The prisoner followed his guide	2219.4521
Here is your chamber for	21.8646
It is late and the	23.4490
Tomorrow perhaps he may change	14.6467
In the meantime there is	468.4489
Goodnight And before Dants could	1349.1559
Dants was alone in darkness	601.3818
With the first dawn of	215.5784
He found the prisoner in	335.9402
He had passed the night	31.3821
The jailer advanced Dants appeared	40.5084
He touched him on the	14.1996

I do not know replied	13.2173
The jailer stared <PAD> <PAD>	9.5893
Are you hungry continued he	11.2461
I do not know Do	778.3754
Dants followed him with his	404.8218
All his emotion then burst	1494.3182
The day passed thus he	2179.2388
One thought in particular tormented	1672.2959
He had no fears as	245.7553
He spoke Italian like a	1150.9305
The thought was maddening and	166.9194
The next morning at the	57.9054
Well said the jailer are	110.5257
Come cheer up is there	468.5872
What you ask is impossible	710.5370
I wish to see him	728.0371
I am not an abb	492.6099
I will make you another	523.1911
The abb began like you	938.8959
All right all right said	118.2486
I will send word to	1045.4067
The jailer went out and	190.3136
By the governors orders said	811.6669
Yes we must put the	416.2946

So serious that I must	731.6157
Alas returned Villefort I must	92.1770

Well asked he as soon	741.9579
Now excuse the indiscretion marquis	1761.6777
Now then said Villefort placing	728.2458
I want a letter that	1251.8802
The keeper would leave me	163.9381
I tell you marquis my	534.0059
I will call Salvieux and	985.1018
Say to the Comte de	342.0675

At his door he perceived	143.1047
It was Mercds who hearing	410.4360
As Villefort drew near she	51.7120
Dants had spoken of Mercds	47.8783
Her beauty and high bearing	920.5630
The young man you speak	657.8271
But at least tell me	433.7314
I do not know he	65.4988
And desirous of putting an	781.6276
But remorse is not thus	1713.6218
Then the first pangs of	136.3625

He had frequently called for	1928.7947
In this case he was	38.9137
As he thus reflected he	1006.6050
It is thus that a	850.5969
If at this moment the	1401.9879
Villefort rose or rather sprang	1308.5536
The hapless Dants was doomed	17.7959
As the marquis had promised	113.9133
He started when he saw	338.1073
Alas her emotions were wholly	192.0721
She loved Villefort and he	174.7179
Villefort knew not when he	1567.3156
Meanwhile what of Mercds <PAD>	8.0783
She had met Fernand at	639.7684
Fernand kneeling by her side	712.5231

But he did not succeed	1121.1428
With his elbows on the	1202.9603

Danglars was one of those	733.2324
Everything with him was multiplication	27.5696

What you do not know	8.8202
Have you neglected to obtain	41.4798
Of course it is of	105.4094
Sire it was impossible to	771.6731
The minister bowed his head	2571.7935
advanced a step and folded	215.5449
So then he exclaimed turning	697.2147
A miracle of heaven replaced	529.8376
I have during those fiveandtwenty	1445.1219

Ridicule sirwhy you know not	1110.7727
Approach and tell monsieur that	636.4443

Unfortunately there are great words	129.8836
Really impossible for a minister	2129.0684
Well then see here is	1195.9900
I do not mean that	70.6387
for if you have discovered	456.1736
Any other than yourself would	3356.2861
Villefort understood the kings intent	15.6240
Any other person would perhaps	1596.9231
In fact the minister who	1377.2858

Do not attribute to me	1024.6130
Tis well resumed the king	11.0963
And now gentlemen he continued	985.0338
Yet speaking of reports baron	1041.5918
Then suddenly pausing he added	1607.5282
Everything points to the conclusion	771.6536
General Quesnel it appears had	171.0346
An unknown person had been	770.7236
The king looked towards him	11.9181

It was thought reliance might	1149.4606
He came there and the	463.8646
When he had heard and	288.6208
Then all looked at each	1137.7051
Yet he did not return	14.6255
What could that mean <PAD>	8.6347
why my dear fellow that	128.6026
A murder <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1351
really Villefort you surprise me	10.7140
You a deputy procureur to	142.7748
Did I ever say to	632.9604
Really my dear Grard you	940.2018
He is pursued But where	18.6308
what is he doing <PAD>	7.9041
You do not know at	971.0171
Believe me we are as	260.5682
Would you like a proof	14.3906
well you wished to conceal	714.8154
You gave your direction to	722.7578
Ring then if you please	1630.0984
the thing is simple enough	13.8129
You who are in power	1268.3469
Yes devotion for that is	1470.7260
Villefort caught his arm <PAD>	10.1446
Wait my dear father said	1315.6611
And what may be that	6078.9912
Villefort watched him with alarm	46.5687
His whiskers cut off Noirtier	2733.2864
Well he said turning towards	1413.7455
Yes yes and now I	509.3659
You are not convinced yet	893.6199
You think he is tracked	455.6588
The soldiers you believe to	2849.5068
Sire go leave France to	1156.4636
Keep your journey a secret	603.4846
Go my songo my dear	2045.0763
This will be added Noirtier	547.2167
Adieu my dear Grard and	957.5057
Villefort pale and agitated ran	1138.5507
Villefort stood watching breathless until	191.2475
Then he turned to the	1006.5105
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Hundred Days M Noirtier	811.6638
Everyone knows the history of	854.7073
Louis XVIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0138
made but a faint attempt	3880.3567
Villefort therefore gained nothing save	935.5678
Napoleon would doubtless have deprived	750.4859
All Villeforts influence barely enabled	504.8914
The kings procureur alone was	195.7381
However scarcely was the imperial	2020.6984
Owing to this change the	1224.6136
Villefort retained his place but	277.8170
If the emperor remained on	1399.2517
returned the influence of M	1191.7391
The deputy procureur was therefore	970.4098
Anyone else would have hastened	571.1237
He made Morrel wait in	512.9232
Morrel expected Villefort would be	1272.3751
He had entered Villeforts office	790.9796
He stopped at the door	588.2121
Morrel I believe said Villefort	9.8708
Yes sir Come nearer said	796.7538
Not in the least but	702.0199
What was the other day	80.9908
You then served Louis XVIII	1465.6615
What is his name said	10.4776
Tell me his name Edmond	1559.2767
Dants repeated he Edmond Dants	1039.5332
Had Morrel been a more	1207.4325
But Morrel disappointed in his	460.0027
Villefort had calculated rightly <PAD>	12.1687
No said Morrel I am	16.4745
I have known him for	164.0596
Do not you recollect I	1603.4202
You received me very coldly	14.4002
Oh the royalists were very	1083.0232
The miraculous return of Napoleon	1865.8362
I like to hear you	847.9569
I recollect now it was	795.5865
What can they have done	1165.6545
Some fine morning he will	753.6403
But how is it he	24.0549
It seems to me the	694.0023
The order of imprisonment came	1249.8184
The emperor is more strict	1595.3385
Well M de Villefort how	88.4303
Petition the minister Oh I	1056.8907
Dants was then guilty and	455.4229
But how shall I address	1028.3280
But lose no time we	128.1791
Only think what the poor	1060.0356
Dants must be crushed to	47.9444
Villefort dictated a petition in	2095.6125
It was evident that at	229.6022
The petition finished Villefort read	32.8846
That will do said he	1117.7958
What more is to be	1002.8169
As for Villefort instead of	1479.9092
Dants remained a prisoner and	960.4479
Twice during the Hundred Days	959.0521
At last there was Waterloo	534.9290
Louis XVIII <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0138
remounted the throne Villefort to	2127.2244
And so Dants after the	921.8400
Danglars comprehended the full extent	1077.6780
But when Napoleon returned to	970.1456
He therefore informed M Morrel	788.4111
He then left for Madrid	47.9722
Fernand understood nothing except that	34.7615
What had become of him	38.9169
Only during the respite the	1488.1277
Fernands mind was made up	105.5208
But Fernand was mistaken a	327.0068
During this time the empire	1746.8085
Fernand departed with the rest	881.8467
Had Fernand really meant to	388.7205
His devotion and the compassion	2032.7407
My brother said she as	954.7338
Should Dants not return Mercds	42.3299
Mercds was left alone face	745.3063
Bathed in tears she wandered	52.5893
Sometimes she stood mute and	2003.7937
It was not want of	1481.9691
Caderousse was like Fernand enrolled	1025.0327
Old Dants who was only	263.1937
Five months after he had	616.8338
M Morrel paid the expenses	754.1166
There was more than benevolence	1009.9701
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Two Prisoners A year	1549.1539
Dants in his cell heard	885.9556
He guessed something uncommon was	1180.1008
The inspector visited one after	2752.0100
He inquired how they were	137.4483
The universal response was that	407.7015
The inspector asked if they	61.9883
They shook their heads <PAD>	12.1014
What could they desire beyond	28.6192
The inspector turned smilingly to	25.4036
I do not know what	1794.6814
Are there any others Yes	1093.2426
We must play the farce	25.7257
Let us see the dungeons	200.7462
The prisoners sometimes through mere	2438.8667
Two soldiers were accordingly sent	1743.6237
Oh cried the inspector who	1172.4191
Is it not true Antoine	29.1123
True enough he wanted to	47.1774
He must be mad said	18.7501
He is worse than thathe	78.1083
Shall I complain of him	25.9205
Oh no it is useless	10.7844
Besides he is almost mad	835.0172
He was as this remark	657.6439
You are right sir replied	444.1919
Now we have in a	1163.4583
He used to weep he	326.4727
You had better see him	1001.8180
Let us visit this one	24.6599
By all means replied the	138.8017
At the sound of the	555.4692
Seeing a stranger escorted by	2170.9766
The soldiers interposed their bayonets	1078.8312
Dants saw that he was	29.4097
Then infusing all the humility	1088.7966
The inspector listened attentively then	2132.1018
I want to know what	1036.7911
I believe so I dont	46.6870
What matters really not only	544.0544
The of February at halfpast	1788.2166
Oh you do not know	1009.6431
Seventeen months captivity to a	2147.8511
Have pity on me then	983.7105
You must show me the	1152.3726
Let me know my crime	59.8613
Uncertainty is worse than all	95.8857
Monsieur cried Dants I can	600.4726
Villefort <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8444
See him and hear what	23.0057
Villefort is no longer at	1255.6694
The door closed but this	155.0027
Will you see the register	895.1402
If I once went up	23.0291
I should never have the	532.5029
The first year he offered	862.8107
He is now in his	562.5025
said the inspector <PAD> <PAD>	6.3918
It is here unlock the	1648.9644
In the centre of the	1196.2756
He was drawing in this	1420.2576
He did not move at	774.9712
He hastily seized the coverlet	119.3845
What is it you want	18.1780
I monsieur replied the abb	880.4719
I was for twenty years	1039.2184
It is for that reason	415.2896
Could you allow me a	214.1893
You knew him returned the	29.4184
What you ask is impossible	55.4228
But said the abb I	691.4839
However continued Faria seeing that	778.2310
Of course said he of	57.5657
Inspector continued the governor I	493.1549
But what if I am	250.4441
this treasure will be lost	12.6467
Had not government better profit	23.6219
I will offer six millions	882.9583
The treasure I speak of	681.5153
Is the spot far from	333.9221
If all the prisoners took	1461.8645
Swear to me replied Faria	643.2324
Monsieur you run no risk	595.4453
Nor you to mine cried	15.2981
You will not accept my	68.3832
You refuse me my liberty	1152.6188
What is he doing there	20.4970
Counting his treasures replied the	15.5171
Faria replied to this sarcasm	69.4418
They went out <PAD> <PAD>	6.8134
The turnkey closed the door	23.4865
He was wealthy once perhaps	29.7172
Or dreamed he was and	706.9449
He remained in his cell	208.0581
Caligula or Nero those treasureseekers	1818.6302
But the kings of modern	967.0608
They fear the ear that	286.7061
Formerly they believed themselves sprung	1313.4497
It has always been against	1296.5330
As the Inquisition rarely allowed	3943.9375
The very madness of the	529.1438
The inspector kept his word	1879.1417
The greatest watchfulness and care	37.2139
This note was in a	601.8419
The inspector could not contend	4064.2334
Days and weeks passed away	822.5694
This fortnight expired he decided	710.1603
Finally ten months and a	979.9156
At the expiration of a	668.5079
He took with him several	124.7818

Number and Number Dants passed	433.3904
He was sustained at first	973.1321
God is always the last	15.4662
Unfortunates who ought to begin	873.1756
Dants asked to be removed	1237.0967
He entreated to be allowed	474.6190
His requests were not granted	112.0218
He accustomed himself to speaking	970.3223
Dants spoke for the sake	593.8763
Often before his captivity Dants	1589.2454
He now wished to be	794.7087
The galleyslaves breathed the fresh	121.5852
They were very happy <PAD>	9.2903
He besought the jailer one	344.6697
The jailer though rough and	605.1063
At the bottom of his	670.2568
Dants had exhausted all human	82.7604
All the pious ideas that	1002.5109
He prayed and prayed aloud	1203.1055
He laid every action of	1559.0068
Then gloom settled heavily upon	26.5832
Dants was a man of	487.4371
He could not do this	1179.2762
Nineteen years of light to	58.3950
No distraction could come to	2210.3945
He clung to one ideathat	3281.2029
Rage supplanted religious fervor <PAD>	18.4321
Dants uttered blasphemies that made	3142.3816
Then the letter that Villefort	1364.7957
He told himself that it	496.0298
He consigned his unknown persecutors	2874.7617
By dint of constantly dwelling	1327.3983
Unhappy he who on the	145.4685
Before him is a dead	1951.3436
Once thus ensnared unless the	2530.5337
This state of mental anguish	2434.4446
There is a sort of	933.6065
Edmond found some solace in	29.7009
All his sorrows all his	1991.8458
Dants reviewed his past life	2530.9004
Sometimes said he in my	683.4279
Then I felt that my	361.8203
Soon the fury of the	615.4166
But I did so because	808.2993
But now it is different	956.5246
Two methods of selfdestruction were	39.2789
He could hang himself with	734.1321
But the first was repugnant	15.9809
Dants had always entertained the	1242.8929
He resolved to adopt the	200.8152
Nearly four years had passed	610.0447
Dants said I wish to	492.9048
When my morning and evening	596.3718
Nothing but the recollection of	78.2355
Hunger made viands once repugnant	1213.4658
It was the last yearning	1856.9445
He was still younghe was	299.4558
What unforseen events might not	216.7216
Then he raised to his	800.5572
He persisted until at last	871.2857
The next morning he could	1392.7130
Thus the day passed away	10.6728
Edmond felt a sort of	1700.7435
It was the twilight of	59.7783
Suddenly about nine oclock in	720.0014
So many loathsome animals inhabited	3294.9280
It was a continual scratching	3322.9753
Although weakened the young mans	420.8371
It seemed to him that	658.2859
Perhaps one of those beloved	751.4284
No no doubtless he was	290.6774
Edmond still heard the sound	11.0786
It lasted nearly three hours	371.9305
Some hours afterwards it began	72.8257
Edmond was intensely interested <PAD>	12.3195
Suddenly the jailer entered <PAD>	8.6413
For a week since he	588.7994
The jailer brought him his	17.8419
Dants raised himself up and	1032.3591
Fortunately he fancied that Dants	419.0106
Edmond listened and the sound	48.4765
There can be no doubt	666.0932
Oh if I were only	1061.7596
It was easy to ascertain	96.8615
It was easy to call	726.7147
Unfortunately Edmonds brain was still	611.3811
He saw but one means	177.7226
He turned his eyes towards	886.8018
He had the resolution to	20.1387
He had often heard that	708.0430
Edmond replaced on the table	647.5908
He soon felt that his	700.9736
Then he said to himself	213.2163
If it is a workman	686.7095
If on the contrary it	514.4666
He struck thrice <PAD> <PAD>	8.9230
At the first blow the	63.6671
Edmond listened intently an hour	1124.9127
Full of hope Edmond swallowed	1396.7632
The day passed away in	173.7088
It is a prisoner said	20.7360
His brain was on fire	50.5944
The night passed in perfect	18.6985
Edmond did not close his	14.3681
In the morning the jailer	1711.0131
At intervals he listened to	979.8357
Three days passedseventytwo long tedious	177.5100
At length one evening as	652.1473
He moved away walked up	690.4664
The matter was no longer	19.2768
Something was at work on	494.3014
Encouraged by this discovery Edmond	121.8019
He began by moving his	1201.9924
He saw nothing he had	1122.6605
All his furniture consisted of	273.4189
The bed had iron clamps	1225.1276
The table and chair had	488.5508
Dants had but one resource	730.8754
He let the jug fall	106.1275
Dants concealed two or three	425.3009
The breaking of his jug	198.9594
Edmond had all the night	342.7742
All night he heard the	115.9549
Day came the jailer entered	11.8326
Dants told him that the	844.0435
He returned speedily advised the	127.6022
Dants heard joyfully the key	1464.2141
The damp had rendered it	1852.3643
The prisoner reproached himself with	1470.2632
During the six years that	138.5220
This idea imparted new energy	1761.7559
The wall was built of	2326.4783
It was one of these	226.4858
Dants strove to do this	116.3843
The fragments of the jug	1383.1471
Was he to be thus	910.0126
Suddenly an idea occurred to	223.0524
The jailer always brought Dants	3557.7437
The handle of this saucepan	894.3032
The jailer was accustomed to	1510.1272
Now when evening came Dants	820.8806
This time he could not	20.4193
He was wrong to leave	229.8996
The jailer therefore only grumbled	18.3376
Then he looked about for	1670.7886
Leave the saucepan said Dants	615.5492
He left the saucepan <PAD>	9.3416
Dants was beside himself with	16.6169
He rapidly devoured his food	1740.2347
A slight oscillation showed Dants	57.4844
At the end of an	799.4623
Dants carefully collected the plaster	484.2642
Then wishing to make the	577.4094
At the dawn of day	444.7076
The breakfast consisted of a	386.9509
Well dont you intend to	70.7246
No replied the turnkey you	23.1285
First you break your jug	1231.9071
I shall leave you the	88.3593
So for the future I	702.4100
He felt more gratitude for	522.3618
He had noticed however that	755.4994
All day he toiled on	1857.6051
When the hour for his	919.0262
The turnkey poured his ration	2041.5464
This would have been a	265.3333
Having poured out the soup	36.5411
Dants wished to ascertain whether	117.5350
He listenedall was silent as	93.9750
Dants sighed it was evident	60.0878
However he toiled on all	1240.3383
The iron made no impression	1284.2588
This beam crossed or rather	2290.1387
The unhappy young man had	26.6792
Oh my God my God	791.6943
After having deprived me of	1337.1205
Edmonds hair stood on end	55.9176
Ah said he I hear	955.0917
In the name of Heaven	298.8628
Who are you Who are	22.6520
An unhappy prisoner replied Dants	90.0736
Of what country A Frenchman	3070.0159
For the emperors returnthe emperor	1565.0571
But how long have you	689.4114
Do not dig any more	1206.3103
Oh what is the matter	16.2280
I have made a mistake	90.9387
I took the wrong angle	227.7821
I took the wall you	746.8792
You mistrust me then said	16.6158
Edmond fancied he heard a	95.9300
Oh I am a Christian	338.0646
I swear to you by	989.7155
If you do I swear	352.1567
Your voice is that of	342.3496
All I do know is	943.6104
I swear to you again	1141.3947
I will not forget you	9.8246
Wait How long I must	829.8174
We will escape and if	422.5922
You must love somebody No	223.8442
If you are young I	211.6193
I have a father who	768.7651
My father has not yet	981.9362
He then gave himself up	24.2495
He would no longer be	15.2032
He was perhaps about to	852.5016
Plaints made in common are	2196.3274
All day Dants walked up	39.2417
He sat down occasionally on	135.1009
At the slightest noise he	35.3511
Once or twice the thought	969.0203
He would be condemned to	1007.3450
The jailer came in the	14.1102
Dants was on his bed	9.4006
It seemed to him that	88.7574
Doubtless there was a strange	679.1675
The jailer went away shaking	26.3303
Night came Dants hoped that	516.4006
The next morning however just	1127.4554
Is it you said he	523.6526
Oh yes yes this instant	770.1846
Then from the bottom of	630.8043
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
A Learned Italian Seizing in	1778.5367
He was a man of	707.7689
He had a deepset penetrating	3158.4133
His thin face deeply furrowed	3820.6418
Large drops of perspiration were	1407.1343
The stranger might have numbered	2744.0168
He received the enthusiastic greeting	3158.0520
He thanked him with grateful	1823.6573
Let us first see said	1708.6299
And with what did you	54.4412
With one of the clamps	1007.2595
Do not speak so loud	73.7118
It frequently occurs in a	1870.6610
I expected as I told	981.2908
My labor is all in	1448.6544
This adjoins the lower part	1324.7091
The fourth and last side	2496.8003
This loophole which gradually diminished	1454.7064
As the stranger asked the	91.1216
Climb up said he to	10.9025
The young man obeyed mounted	1075.7900
The stranger whom as yet	1125.4407
An instant afterwards he hastily	1068.2767
What was it that you	243.8236
The elder prisoner pondered the	24.4361
Yes said he at length	17.5922
This side of your chamber	2621.1899
I saw the soldiers shape	781.8990
You perceive then the utter	672.1669
Then answered the elder prisoner	914.7617
Dants gazed on the man	2623.5845
Tell me I entreat of	74.2521
Never have I met with	1289.3302
Pray let me know who	147.5737
Then listen said he <PAD>	8.1638
I am the Abb Faria	878.8959
In the year I was	45.6611
It was at this period	1469.0760
I was very far then	1012.3094
Then who reigns in France	57.9001
No Louis XVIII The brother	50.2040
How inscrutable are the ways	1915.8390
Yes yes continued he Twill	83.1872
After Charles I Cromwell after	2956.5051
Then new concessions to the	81.1421
Ah my friend said the	895.1710
It was the plan of	23.5681
and Clement VII but it	2045.1046
Italy seems fated to misfortune	92.8496
Dants could not understand a	88.2345
Napoleon certainly he knew something	654.1923
and Alexander VI <PAD> <PAD>	10.7018
he knew nothing <PAD> <PAD>	7.2737
Are you not he asked	1032.0707
Well then resumed Faria with	947.6749
Would it not be expecting	176.0249
Why not try to find	1596.3330
In the first place I	1011.9079
Whole days have I passed	2616.9863
Consider also that I fully	733.8466
No I repeat again that	2617.7200
The abb sank upon Edmonds	136.9572
Escape had never once occurred	18.8078
There are indeed some things	784.5847
To undermine the ground for	1797.6028
But the sight of an	790.0945
Another older and less strong	1121.5614
This same person with almost	3452.0671
Another had done all this	57.8052
Faria had dug his way	1514.6460
He could do it in	750.9595
At once Dants resolved to	992.3074
After continuing some time in	952.1029
We must pierce through the	1160.6284
This time you will lay	1229.2600
All we require to insure	933.5785
As for patience I consider	1092.0469
But then young man and	399.8816
Hitherto I have fancied myself	159.3101
I have thought it no	1049.7787
Is it possible said he	1171.3389
Because said the old man	574.1970
The tiger whose nature teaches	2750.7454
Since my imprisonment said Faria	610.0322
They have rarely been successful	15.4815
Those that have been crowned	1423.7292
Then there are those for	332.0656
Let us therefore wait patiently	1571.3054
Faria saw this <PAD> <PAD>	6.3956
When you pay me a	639.9979
The work I speak of	1342.8628
I invented a preparation that	1723.2548
I devoted three years of	1541.3685
I could recite you the	33801.0586
I name only the most	1156.7891
I know nearly one thousand	1167.4946
I can not hope to	1241.3464
You are aware what huge	220.0031
Well I selected the cartilages	798.8112
While retracing the past I	980.8328
Still it must have been	1370.4045
For very important notes for	1675.5485
Oh then let it be	37.8927
Follow me then said the	544.6990
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Abbs Chamber After having	3673.1997
The floor of the abbs	623.1607
As he entered the chamber	1056.8005
It is well said the	1564.3103
Look at this ray of	976.4318
Well by means of these	775.0540
A double movement of the	752.5195
Each word that fell from	1655.0276
Come said he to the	713.3240
What do you wish to	30.6157
Oh your great work on	1787.4945
These rolls consisted of slips	4240.1021
There said he there is	20.3628
I wrote the word finis	392.9019
I have torn up two	902.3803
Should I ever get out	1219.0706
Now let me behold the	1304.1483
Dants examined it with intense	1352.8065
Ah yes said Faria the	17.9424
Thats my masterpiece <PAD> <PAD>	8.0759
I made it as well	2086.0195
Dants examined the various articles	1025.1736
As for the ink said	916.6909
Nightwhy for Heavens sake are	932.1297
I furnished myself with a	29.9163
Pray tell me how I	1049.0751
But how do you procure	1712.0463
You have not seen all	806.8860
Let us shut this one	1564.1917
Behind the head of the	861.3209
Dants closely and eagerly examined	955.7541
Who supplied you with the	1920.1824
I once thought continued Faria	1545.8385
Nevertheless I carefully preserved my	1511.7101
What are you thinking of	1006.5911
I was reflecting in the	1129.0496
What would you not have	844.2290
Compression is needed to explode	25.8596
Captivity has brought my mental	1816.0677
I know nothing <PAD> <PAD>	6.7237
Some of your words are	49.7091
You must be blessed indeed	166.1442
Well said he but you	520.0475
I would fain fix the	1644.2972
From this point everything was	814.7570
His recital finished the abb	56.1299
There is said he at	702.2971
Still from an artificial civilization	5405.6992
From this view of things	1200.7854
Now to apply it in	965.0510
I was a very insignificant	3522.8533
Now in the event of	1814.1125
Well these twelve thousand livres	1181.8922
Everyone from the highest to	1658.4862
But these forces increase as	2085.3889
Now let us return to	29.1442
You say you were on	522.4898
But let us first settle	937.0250
What say you I can	38.5710
I was generally liked on	1408.5172
There was only one person	267.5079
I had quarelled with him	1242.1896
And what was this mans	1255.4911
Now then tell me was	2049.3687
Did you take anybody with	1581.1168
Now how could a sailor	1647.6071
Do you recollect the words	926.5828
This proof of his guilt	1247.2500
The thing is clear as	539.5432
Ah that would indeed be	2129.4307
Disguised It was very boldly	1800.2628
Dants drew back and gazed	213.1566
How very astonishing cried he	22.7815
Why your writing exactly resembles	1328.1176
Pray was Danglars acquainted with	39.9477
Now I recollect What To	2884.6030
They were in earnest conversation	13.8404
Danglars was joking in a	1699.9166
StaystayHow strange that it should	44.1673
Now I remember quite well	715.9370
Oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels	400.2185
Is there anything else I	985.3484
Yes yes replied Dants eagerly	561.0843
The ways of justice are	249.5244
All we have hitherto done	103.4392
If you wish me to	533.4501
Old enough to be ambitious	69.6889
And how did he treat	1731.4396
He seemed quite overcome by	1497.4553
the accusation No the letter	342.1765
This man might after all	1137.0028
Is the world filled with	2120.9670
You tell me he burned	797.7795
To whom was this letter	144.2929
Paris Now can you conceive	1237.0229
What was your deputy called	1453.1646
What ails you said he	18.2018
Do you see that ray	871.4361
Poor fellow <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4485
poor young man <PAD> <PAD>	6.3604
And you tell me this	1342.3832
This Noirtier was his father	2293.7375
Starting up he clasped his	1364.2855
his father Yes his father	932.1813
The change that had come	1096.6028
He cried out and staggered	925.8492
During these hours of profound	1156.5105
Dants was at length roused	1103.5837
The reputation of being out	2034.7821
He was supplied with bread	3574.3601
Now this was a Sunday	534.9395
Dants followed him his features	925.2022
Faria bent on him his	24.0769
I regret now said he	1122.3875
Because it has instilled a	267.7502
Let us talk of something	24.9034
Again the abb looked at	970.9199
The elder prisoner was one	1695.8264
Dants listened with admiring attention	1317.9448
A part of the good	1805.1669
You must teach me a	919.1042
I can well believe that	1612.1332
If you will only agree	1341.7977
Alas my boy said he	3057.1489
Now it will scarcely require	1087.4160
Memory makes the one philosophy	1147.8536
I am in a hurry	17.9093
I want to learn Everything	28.3444
And that very evening the	420.0919
Dants possessed a prodigious memory	4316.4507
He already knew Italian and	1490.0164
In strict accordance with the	242.5970
Perhaps the delight his studies	1215.9884
Days even months passed by	160.3262
At the end of a	39.4119
Dants observed however that Faria	3350.6096
Sometimes he would fall into	3071.5945
One day he stopped all	728.3094
I have already told you	1010.4147
I could never agree to	360.8661
And you have discovered a	259.4249
I have if it were	1120.9375
No no cried the abb	1372.6942
Three months passed away <PAD>	10.7815
Are you strong the abb	35.3038
The young man in reply	942.2704
And will you engage not	878.4598
Do you consider the last	142.1952
Forgive me cried Edmond blushing	22.1624
Tut tut answered the abb	777.9431
Come let me show you	784.7605
It consisted of a plan	364.7360
In this passage he proposed	1315.1625
The prisoners were then to	607.3387
Dants eyes sparkled with joy	967.6475
That very day the miners	2360.5383
Nothing interrupted the progress of	1031.2806
They had learned to distinguish	1613.7306
The fresh earth excavated during	2228.3599
More than a year had	1061.6680
The abb was a man	475.5301
At the end of fifteen	1135.8984
Compelled as they were to	1652.7224
Dants was occupied in arranging	1082.3438
Dants hastened to his dungeon	697.1678
Gracious heavens exclaimed Dants what	26.2012
what has happened Quick <PAD>	13.0305
quick returned the abb listen	656.3392
Tell me I beseech you	389.3752
Alas faltered out the abb	39.9567
I am seized with a	728.0358
I had a similar attack	69.1928
This malady admits but of	133.7483
Go into my cell as	611.9802
Bring it to meor ratherno	1217.1184
Who knows what may happen	1131.6312
Thanks said the poor abb	208.2608
I am about to be	1262.9509
On the other hand the	1412.5629
Take care my cries are	717.4421
When I become quite motionless	2581.4087
Help <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8461
help cried the abb IIdieI	1044.6902
The fit lasted two hours	4056.7673
Edmond waited till life seemed	1227.7365
An hour passed away and	163.6385
Dants began to fear he	1504.0906
At length a slight color	4240.5186
He is saved <PAD> <PAD>	6.9574
he is saved cried Dants	48.2964
The sick man was not	457.7498
Dants listened and plainly distinguished	74.9719
It was therefore near seven	645.4033
The young man sprang to	1003.2607
He had scarcely done so	613.1365
Almost before the key had	640.6406
Faria had now fully regained	886.0887
I did not expect to	82.4086
And why not asked the	15.6315
Did you fancy yourself dying	998.3254
Without you <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.4758
Did you really think me	903.1952
Alas alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0823
I am fearfully exhausted and	2132.0664
The abb shook his head	13.4276
The last attack I had	685.4062
The third attack will either	1985.1506
And your third attack if	183.6905
We shall save you another	854.8105
The attack which has just	294.0864
None can fly from a	1903.0966
Everything is in readiness for	250.0254
As soon as you feel	552.1832
This arm is paralyzed not	47.0787
Lift it and judge if	997.0447
A sigh escaped him <PAD>	10.6704
You are convinced now Edmond	47.3501
Depend upon it I know	18.7088
Since the first attack I	190.9585
Indeed I expected it for	664.0002
The physician who prepared for	1511.3778
And as for your poor	60.4173
I can take you on	570.8576
Cease then to allow yourself	1389.2355
Here I shall remain till	812.2906
As for you who are	1013.3817
Then I shall also remain	1229.3457
Thanks murmured the invalid extending	25.3818
I accept <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9204
You may one of these	162.6179
But as I can not	900.7523
That would bring about a	258.8264
Go then and set about	939.0231
I shall have something of	415.3858
Faria smiled encouragingly on him	836.1786
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Treasure When Dants returned	1508.7560
In the ray of light	725.5080
He did not speak but	38.3999
What is that he inquired	9.1216
Look at it said the	20.5564
I have looked at it	626.6871
Until this day and for	807.1755
With his instinctive delicacy Edmond	3154.1301
He had taken the silence	492.5091
Your treasure stammered Dants <PAD>	12.3545
Faria smiled <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5868
Yes said he <PAD> <PAD>	5.3893
You have indeed a noble	833.0681
No be assured I am	19.6911
This treasure exists Dants and	191.5122
Yesyou <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8482
No one would listen or	714.5479
There was only this blow	1254.6484
Tomorrow if you will I	290.4052
Besides he said a treasure	567.9906
Who knows if tomorrow or	246.1034
and then must not all	16.3329
Yes indeed I have often	1009.8588
This idea was one of	397.9260
But now I have forgiven	271.0100
You persist in your incredulity	45.1062
My words have not convinced	13.9402
I see you require proofs	13.7161
Well then read this paper	1036.9365
I thought it was understood	595.0169
April Well said Faria when	73.0015
Why replied Dants I see	1522.9404
Steps approachI goadieu And Dants	1832.8992
It was the governor who	444.7822
Faria sat up to receive	1206.2367
His fear was lest the	1535.3345
But fortunately this was not	546.9425
During this time Edmond seated	805.8832
Faria since their first acquaintance	2230.3445
Was Faria deceived as to	203.7922
Dants remained in his cell	835.9111
But towards the evening after	791.6271
Edmond shuddered when he heard	1447.0803
Edmond was obliged to assist	781.5590
Here I am pursuing you	88.5134
You thought to escape my	58.6728
Listen to me Edmond saw	565.8431
You know said the abb	500.9088
I owe to this worthy	82.5231
He was not rich although	713.1105
I was tutor to his	670.9321
The cardinals house had no	29.1982
I had often seen my	2180.2520
One day when I was	1276.7316
There in the twentieth chapter	2079.4668
The pope had also need	393.3304
King of France who was	1011.4458
His holiness had an idea	13.9449
He determined to make two	2294.4871
In the first place he	1052.1079
There was a third point	81.8243
The pope and Csar Borgia	2545.1580
They were ambitious and Csar	214.1122
The result was that Rospigliosi	1769.7563
It is time now to	68.8796
The pope heaped attentions upon	4344.4883
Then the pope and Csar	114.7545
This was a matter of	111.9934
Csar thought they could make	442.6906
This key was furnished with	403.7450
When this was pressed to	662.5021
Then there was the ring	962.3109
The lion bit the hand	686.2110
Csar proposed to his father	919.1279
replied Now as to the	1515.3467
Besides you forget Csar an	2967.3391
The table was laid in	2292.0212
Rospigliosi quite set up with	705.4164
Spada a prudent man and	1031.5521
He then sent word to	672.9343
Spada knew what these invitations	3195.0830
The pope awaited him <PAD>	11.7032
The first sight that attracted	1284.6166
Spada turned pale as Csar	997.0695
They began dinner and Spada	618.8091
The nephew replied no perfectly	79.0306
It was too late for	1211.2443
Spada at the same moment	225.3195
An hour afterwards a physician	330.4612
Spada died on the threshold	1206.6066
Then Csar and the pope	1080.8254
But the inheritance consisted in	2122.5100
That was all <PAD> <PAD>	5.7458
Csar and his father searched	2056.6531
There were two palaces and	2269.9539
Months and years rolled on	11.5805
Alexander VI <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.3839
died poisonedyou know by what	21.5853
Csar poisoned at the same	1933.2069
Then compelled to quit Rome	1882.9573
After the popes death and	1656.6090
The Spadas remained in doubtful	2386.7083
I say the two because	425.4327
Up to this point said	1660.2292
The family began to get	46.4076
Years rolled on and amongst	3475.7361
I come now to the	240.7526
I had often heard him	928.9894
He did so and thus	32.5188
The celebrated breviary remained in	106.8520
It had been handed down	635.5151
It was an illuminated book	2329.5566
At the sight of papers	1497.1769
Yet I had read I	1247.0419
I was then almost assured	1699.3363
I searched ransacked counted calculated	1870.3934
It was useless <PAD> <PAD>	6.8892
I remained in my ignorance	90.6859
My patron died <PAD> <PAD>	8.8611
He had reserved from his	2075.6311
All these he bequeathed to	769.6207
All this I did scrupulously	12.4536
Be easy my dear Edmond	53.0560
In a month before I	402.7937
I awoke as the clock	32.9002
I raised my head I	34.1476
I rang for a light	238.8553
It was indeed but anticipating	591.1403
I took a waxcandle in	1013.3164
Fearing however to make use	918.5469
I felt for it found	1185.1208
But beneath my fingers as	1858.8198
I grasped it in my	920.2001
It was that paper you	616.4460
Two open in these caves	1087.2806
April <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8481
Cs And now said the	803.5238
And now he said when	736.5762
Two openings have been made	1022.2408
April <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8481
Csar Spada Well do you	54.2749
It is the declaration of	463.2187
Yes a thousand times yes	151.7589
Aided by the remaining fragment	791.1014
Now continued Faria addressing Dants	1066.3306
If we ever escape together	1253.1888
The last Count of Spada	2133.3730
If we lay hands on	1788.5483
Impossible <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8443
and why asked the old	13.4694
The Spada family was one	1350.7233
I have only kept this	1085.9387
Had we escaped before my	718.7223
Well Dants you do not	585.5457
I have no right to	11.4074
I am no relation of	182.8502
You are the child of	16.5341
My profession condemns me to	25.6677
God has sent you to	287.0623
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Third Attack Now that	1868.7887
The abb did not know	874.7717
This island was always had	63.0156
It is a rock of	1838.0638
Dants drew a plan of	855.3181
But Dants was far from	140.4315
It was past a question	486.1999
However as if fate resolved	1287.2974
They had repaired it completely	1296.6992
But for this precaution which	550.7338
Thus a new a stronger	1009.2527
You see said the young	914.1255
I have promised to remain	378.8022
The treasure will be no	392.7668
But my real treasure is	974.6279
These different sciences that you	668.0564
Believe me and take comfort	1113.9780
To have you as long	1828.4341
I owe you my real	1433.3741
Faria who for so long	434.1046
As he had prophesied would	646.4480
But he was continually thinking	1193.6523
For fear the letter might	1124.8011
Then he destroyed the second	965.4349
Whole hours sometimes passed while	1472.2177
Then once free from the	415.0336
In the meanwhile the hours	90.9377
Faria as we have said	642.0422
They were thus perpetually employedFaria	1918.4425
So life went on for	1194.1379
But beneath this superficial calm	430.2567
One night Edmond awoke suddenly	157.7697
He opened his eyes upon	26.1206
His name or rather a	298.4713
He sat up in bed	191.9480
Undoubtedly the call came from	26.9962
Alas murmured Edmond can it	1012.3172
By the light of the	689.7480
His features were writhing with	1457.1377
Alas my dear friend said	551.4665
Silence he said or you	14.1813
We must now only think	872.8039
It would require years to	914.7268
Besides be assured my dear	1083.2686
Perhaps he will be young	641.4240
You will no longer have	509.5260
At length Providence has done	783.4302
See he exclaimed there remains	74.2139
Quick quick <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9834
tell me what I must	99.9978
Speak my friend I listen	1252.1095
The cold gains upon me	16.2292
I feel the blood flowing	39.1170
These horrible chills which make	3932.7712
Do as you did before	660.1165
If after having made me	1239.8279
Now lift me on my	820.1169
And now my dear friend	2634.6570
My son I bless thee	1570.6605
Listen now to what I	39.9848

Dants raised his head and	95.1333
It seemed as if a	190.3542
Adieu adieu murmured the old	1857.9886
Oh succor him <PAD> <PAD>	7.8725
Helphelphelp Hush <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.1801

Oh yes yes be assured	37.9225
Besides although you suffer much	831.9450
I suffer less because there	107.1565

The crisis was terrible and	5800.9292
Dants took the lamp placed	1785.1606
With steady gaze he awaited	181.4909
When he believed that the	1331.7252
He waited ten minutes a	342.1476
Trembling his hair erect his	795.9147
Then he thought it was	475.0084
The draught produced a galvanic	3127.1230
Half an hour an hour	1297.4160
It was six oclock in	1096.2792
Strange shadows passed over the	356.9807
While the struggle between day	1417.0194
Then an invincible and extreme	1165.2988
He extinguished the lamp carefully	811.4656
It was time for the	20.3680
On this occasion he began	1273.1265
Nothing betokened that the man	58.0270
He went on his way	10.3816
Dants was then seized with	639.3683
He therefore returned by the	919.2800
Other turnkeys came and then	108.4882
Last of all came the	12.4116
Edmond heard the creaking of	528.3365
The governor then went out	993.0109
Well well said one the	96.9625
Good journey to him With	616.2224
Oh added a third voice	1215.7483
The voices soon ceased and	228.3940
Still he dared not to	272.9843
He remained therefore mute and	99.7332
At the end of an	96.3608
It was the governor who	84.9088
There was a moments silenceit	191.2420
The inquiries soon commenced <PAD>	14.0143
The doctor analyzed the symptoms	685.3121
Questions and answers followed in	924.3291
I am very sorry for	445.4043
You may make your mind	67.7698
I will answer for that	904.8630
In spite of all appearances	2040.7599
He heard hasty steps the	1441.7742
The perspiration poured forth upon	432.7088
You see sir he is	315.9026
The poor fool is cured	1560.8270
Yes sir and as he	38.3180
He was too very learned	987.7655
You had never anything to	275.1282
Never sir replied the jailer	687.1976
One day too when my	1273.9220
Will that satisfy you Must	551.3994
Certainly <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8421
But make hasteI can not	1814.8558
This evening said the governor	10.4770
Will there be any mass	43.5804
That is impossible replied the	14.1171
The chaplain of the chteau	988.5359
I told him I would	61.8355
If the poor abb had	869.1711
God will respect his profession	1143.8469
Meanwhile the operation of putting	86.1857

At what hour inquired a	17.9495

Shut the dungeon as if	799.4189
Then he raised the flagstone	207.9913
It was empty and Dants	42.2593

The Cemetery of the Chteau	1590.8376
Everything was in readiness <PAD>	8.8510
A barrier had been placed	62.4457
No longer could Edmond look	1445.0282
Faria the beneficent and cheerful	736.7673
He seated himself on the	410.2482
Alone <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8474
he was alone again <PAD>	8.4516
again condemned to silenceagain face	57.3592
Alonenever again to see the	499.0563
Was not Farias fate the	1877.2073
The idea of suicide which	1620.2489
If I could die he	346.3141
But how to die <PAD>	8.3927
It is very easy he	788.4055
Dants recoiled from the idea	1306.8676
Die <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8408
oh no he exclaimednot die	316.6736
Die <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8408
yes had I died years	835.4668
No I want to live	619.3041
Before I die I must	777.3469
Yet they will forget me	695.3697
Suddenly he arose lifted his	1792.6809
Just God he muttered whence	36.5769
Is it from thee <PAD>	8.9885
Since none but the dead	1178.0111
He would have been discovered	771.6492
Dants might have waited until	788.2077
In that case his last	47.6262
Now his plans were fully	105.3989
If while he was being	962.2031
If they took him to	528.9672
He hoped that the weight	281.5879
If he was detected in	983.8808
Dants had not eaten since	651.4992
His situation was too precarious	361.1201
The first risk that Dants	1030.5900
This time the jailer might	585.7563
When seven oclock came Dants	46.0668
His hand placed upon his	1374.5302
From time to time chills	862.1859
Then he thought he was	18.5998
Yet the hours passed on	621.2595
It was a good augury	12.2792
At length about the hour	192.2398
Edmond felt that the moment	810.7447
The footstepsthey were doublepaused at	2425.1409
The door opened and a	1652.4552
The two men approaching the	251.6807

They say every year adds	928.5559
Have you tied the knot	43.8573
What would be the use	598.4777
Whats the knot for thought	15.2672
They deposited the supposed corpse	36.9281
Edmond stiffened himself in order	558.3824
Suddenly he felt the fresh	369.5603
It was a sensation in	101.6134
The bearers went on for	395.5399
One of them went away	147.4444
Where am I he asked	11.8281
Really he is by no	696.2765
Dants first impulse was to	109.7799
Give us a light said	566.6521
What can he be looking	23.7140
The spade perhaps An exclamation	810.1399
Here it is at last	551.5378
Well have you tied the	106.6504
Yes and pretty tight too	69.1323
Move on then And the	110.9101
They advanced fifty paces farther	341.4172
The noise of the waves	1849.6431
Bad weather observed one of	1184.5168
Dants did not comprehend the	177.6929
Well here we are at	29.8495

Although drawn downwards by the	1763.1350

He then bent his body	1203.8756
With a mighty leap he	893.1657
Dants waited only to get	259.8713
When he arose a second	244.2570
He saw overhead a black	4833.1768
Behind him blacker than the	6090.9048
He fancied that these two	874.4769
Dants dived again and remained	71.1814
This was an easy feat	1164.0071
When he came up again	30.1995
He must now get his	19.0707
Ratonneau and Pomgue are the	2409.8176
Tiboulen and Lemaire were therefore	62.8481
The islands of Tiboulen and	1417.1073
But how could he find	61.3069
At this moment he saw	349.8628
By leaving this light on	582.9620
But as we have said	268.8005
Often in prison Faria had	777.6965
He found with pleasure that	559.1802
Fear that relentless pursuer clogged	50.6860
He listened for any sound	766.4010
He fancied that every wave	2038.8535
He swam on still and	154.3557
He could not see it	40.0708
An hour passed during which	474.1387
Let us see said he	837.7167
But what if I were	69.6754
He sought to tread water	743.6095
Well said he I will	827.0100
Suddenly the sky seemed to	1765.2810
He fancied for a moment	336.2391
Then he put out his	915.1038
Before him rose a grotesque	1642.6117
It was the Island of	14.3945

At the expiration of an	165.9176
The tempest was let loose	2102.7383
Dants had not been deceivedhe	366.5393
He knew that it was	1281.5580
An overhanging rock offered him	2352.9080
Edmond felt the trembling of	1374.0040
He was safely sheltered and	1152.5121
It seemed to him that	850.5352
He then recollected that he	159.2981
He extended his hands and	663.0532
As he rose a flash	1081.7091
By its light between the	2302.7974
A second after he saw	84.2401
Dants cried at the top	375.8629
Another flash showed him four	2374.3127

Above the splintered mast a	2645.3621
At the same moment a	124.2133
Dants from his rocky perch	1818.9104
Then all was dark again	11.4699
Dants ran down the rocks	1119.3735
By degrees the wind abated	7210.5381
Soon a red streak became	3049.6013
It was day <PAD> <PAD>	6.1174
Dants stood mute and motionless	1181.0878
He turned towards the fortress	95.2891
The gloomy building rose from	876.9243
It was about five oclock	11.7964
The sea continued to get	21.2689
In two or three hours	1138.3894
Then the tunnel will be	573.0999

What can I do <PAD>	7.4059
What story can I invent	14.8606
under pretext of trading along	2119.7134
I must wait <PAD> <PAD>	7.2570
But I cannotI am starving	17.5574

I am saved murmured he	12.6340
And this conviction restored his	20.5416

However the vessel and the	1921.6451

It was then he rejoiced	811.2513
Dants though almost sure as	1330.3492
Then he advanced but before	160.2311
By a violent effort he	1750.8529
This time he was both	192.5417
At the same time he	70.7388
An instant after the boat	167.7689

His arms became stiff his	275.5406

The two sailors redoubled their	1379.1272

I am replied Dants in	64.1616
We were coming from Syracuse	53.2736

You have saved my life	51.2124
I was lost when one	569.1155

Leave me at the first	704.7218
But in his present condition	777.3287
We shall see returned the	19.2245

Bravo repeated the sailors <PAD>	9.2987
And they all looked with	1241.6844
You see said Dants quitting	583.6449
If you do not want	365.6024
Thats not fair said the	532.1097
Everyone is free to ask	1255.1139
Jacopo dived into the hold	100.5844
Now then do you wish	51.2496

What is this asked the	11.7634

Pretty strong rum said Dants	106.9079
At any rate murmured he	1643.2000
Dants could thus keep his	30.7192

It was fourteen years day	64.4408
He was nineteen when he	229.5665
A sorrowful smile passed over	783.1146

At first the captain had	201.7865
He was very well known	809.0089
But the skilful manner in	873.6779
This made him less uneasy	1319.4791
Edmond thus had the advantage	537.8768
Thus the Genoese subtle as	2369.2009
Moreover it is possible that	778.7021

When the operation was concluded	1451.0616
He was now as we	1345.6401

This was now all changed	11.3750

Moreover from being so long	1408.6354
Edmond smiled when he beheld	1473.0083

His next care on leaving	1583.3440
It was in this costume	1138.5675
Attracted by his prepossessing appearance	1341.4535

Dants thought as they passed	557.5596
But then what could he	398.6899
Besides what would the sailors	13.8791
What would the patron think	11.2596
He must wait <PAD> <PAD>	7.2692
Fortunately Dants had learned how	769.3606
Would he not have accepted	168.8246
Besides were not those riches	670.0858
It is true the letter	903.8135
Evening came and Edmond saw	963.6605

Jacopo seeing him fall had	944.6733
This world was not then	1282.7753
Fortunately as we have said	1023.1561
Edmond then resolved to try	1143.5808
As a result of the	881.3557

And from this time the	243.4905

All was useless the treasure	827.3571
The day came at length	500.8500
Night came and with it	387.5229
He had by degrees assumed	1099.9209
The old patron did not	694.9152
He saw in the young	488.7847
At seven oclock in the	1207.2966
The sea was calm and	1837.4584
Dants told them that all	136.7478
When the Maltese for so	883.2527
This frequently happened <PAD> <PAD>	8.8578
Dants cast from solitude into	2528.3879
Now this solitude was peopled	1087.3025
When the patron awoke the	1135.3558
They were making nearly ten	46.2034
The Island of Monte Cristo	60.4999
Edmond resigned the lugger to	787.1252
Two hours afterwards he came	407.4997
They were just abreast of	687.5542
The peak of Monte Cristo	485.3928
Dants ordered the helmsman to	1328.2264
About five oclock in the	1207.5840
Edmond gazed very earnestly at	1850.1583
Never did a gamester whose	1689.0072
Night came and at ten	30.8390
La Jeune Amlie was first	32.6171
In spite of his usual	217.9754
He was the first to	1099.0244
The island was familiar to	586.6080
As to Dants he had	380.3147
He questioned Jacopo <PAD> <PAD>	9.1656
Where shall we pass the	23.4707
Why on board the tartan	28.0173
Should we not do better	730.9991
The cold sweat sprang forth	51.8938
What are there no grottos	43.3710
None For a moment Dants	1635.5042
The point was then to	36.5536
It was useless to search	332.3628
Besides a signal made half	1353.0497
The boat that now arrived	1168.5344
Then the landing began <PAD>	9.4294
Dants reflected as he worked	1062.4945
Fortunately as regarded this circumstance	1705.5303
No one had the slightest	1512.0366
However Jacopo insisted on following	1402.2548
Scarcely however had they gone	1126.8341
This and some dried fruits	422.7885
Dants went on looking from	82.1430
Having reached the summit of	1155.7156
Edmond looked at them for	468.6245
In two hours time said	2020.9575
At this moment hope makes	241.4623
Yet perchance tomorrow deception will	1808.3959
Oh no exclaimed Edmond that	20.8478
The wise unerring Faria could	120.5139
Besides it were better to	1154.3287
The cause was not in	1028.4260
Meanwhile by a cleft between	1528.3922
Keeping along the shore and	2379.1033
Time which encrusts all physical	3121.3906
Occasionally the marks were hidden	8248.4873
So Edmond had to separate	591.2607
The sight of marks renewed	60.9680
Might it not have been	526.5125
This solitary place was precisely	433.4353
Only might not these betraying	474.1828
and had the dark and	257.1163
It seemed however to Edmond	1000.7199
A large round rock placed	915.3442
Edmond concluded that perhaps instead	937.0854
Meanwhile his comrades had prepared	1402.4653
Just at the moment when	1272.9596
The sportsman instantly changed his	119.0368
But even while they watched	2003.4268
They all rushed towards him	784.9113
He found Edmond lying prone	90.5977
He had rolled down a	95.6979
They poured a little rum	1208.7966
Edmond opened his eyes complained	1474.8131
They wished to carry him	1584.3711
It may be supposed that	709.0389
As for himself he declared	430.4478
The sailors did not require	32.6499
They were hungry and the	1332.9705
An hour afterwards they returned	13.7399
All that Edmond had been	1052.7769
But instead of growing easier	175.7565
The old patron who was	844.3683
Edmond made great exertions in	1047.2543
He has broken his ribs	91.0193
No matter he is an	80.2982
We will try and carry	1032.0914
Well said the patron let	799.4868
We will not go till	447.4958
The patron was so strict	831.1064
Dants would not allow that	839.9951
No no he said to	359.5994
Leave me a small supply	2049.0178
I would rather do so	2717.7922
What are we to do	29.4876
We can not leave you	299.5016
We shall be absent at	776.2678
I will pay twentyfive piastres	100.4149
If you do not come	184.1364
Listen Captain Baldi theres one	127.3351
Do you go and I	461.0829
A day or two of	1013.3628
The smugglers left with Edmond	1406.5728
Then when they had disappeared	726.0562
At the end of an	509.4845
Then Dants rose more agile	2040.2355
And now he exclaimed remembering	2373.0869
The Secret Cave The sun	3342.0759
Thousands of grasshoppers hidden in	2177.8923
At every step that Edmond	1859.4493
In a word the island	467.6949
He felt an indescribable sensation	2978.3296
This feeling was so strong	856.4641
But it was not upon	837.0395
It was at the brigantine	533.0588
The first was just disappearing	1146.4954
This sight reassured him <PAD>	11.2214
He then looked at the	24.7630
He saw that he was	1490.6652
Then he descended with cautious	1818.4039
Dants as we have said	541.1450
This creek was sufficiently wide	1034.8762
Then following the clew that	955.2812
It was this idea that	98.4361
One thing only perplexed Edmond	62.9048
How could this rock which	1308.6554
Suddenly an idea flashed across	29.5994
Instead of raising it thought	38.0697
And he sprang from the	427.2842
He soon perceived that a	995.6266
A large stone had served	1575.6414
Dants dug away the earth	493.0002
He attacked this wall cemented	115.9365
After ten minutes labor the	781.6764
Dants went and cut the	2228.7827
But the rock was too	1176.3406
Dants saw that he must	27.1517
But how <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.2168
He cast his eyes around	590.6999
He smiled the infernal invention	92.3305
With the aid of his	1728.4591
He lighted it and retired	11.8913
The explosion soon followed the	2199.6479
Dants approached the upper rock	240.3923
The intrepid treasureseeker walked round	3826.8740
The rock already shaken by	146.0950
Dants redoubled his efforts he	1633.9022
The rock yielded rolled over	561.2154
On the spot it had	1367.9628
Dants uttered a cry of	831.5991
He would fain have continued	1613.8459
This feeling lasted but for	21.2509
Edmond inserted his lever in	2219.4246
Anyone else would have rushed	55.8802
Dants turned pale hesitated and	20.2802
Come said he to himself	14.7203
I am accustomed to adversity	15.0651
I must not be cast	111.5058
What then would be the	39.3163
The heart breaks when after	1376.7302
Faria has dreamed this the	1682.9664
Now that I expect nothing	1239.6511
Yes yes this is an	420.2411
This fabulous event formed but	230.3129
Yes Borgia has been here	698.8116
The fate replied he smiling	1481.3510
I will go down Then	1476.6307
After having stood a few	1837.6555
Alas said Edmond smiling these	686.7154
In the farthest angle of	73.0674
He had only found the	91.5330
Dants continued his search <PAD>	9.4610
He reflected that this second	1690.5172
The pickaxe struck for a	1054.5428
At last it seemed to	920.2563
However he like Csar Borgia	1375.7944
He again struck it and	29.0411
Then a singular thing occurred	14.7359
As he struck the wall	1257.4436
The aperture of the rock	2024.6508
Dants struck with the sharp	282.6065
It was there he must	15.0638
But by some strange play	1495.9851
This last proof instead of	1541.6611
The island was deserted and	2448.8501
Dants had tasted nothing but	945.8105
The pickaxe that had seemed	859.8765
After several blows he perceived	956.3901
He had nothing more to	664.2855
The aperture was already sufficiently	1422.8959
At last after renewed hesitation	78.7036
The second grotto was lower	1073.0686
He waited in order to	522.8791
At the left of the	57.4153
But to Dants eye there	25.1409
He glanced around this second	91.8429
The treasure if it existed	58.6708
The time had at length	446.9256
He advanced towards the angle	317.0359
At the fifth or sixth	246.3094
Never did funeral knell never	455.8985
Had Dants found nothing he	95.2903
He again struck his pickaxe	418.8907
It is a casket of	69.4616
At this moment a shadow	1152.1193
A wild goat had passed	558.6251
This would have been a	1369.2739
He thought a moment cut	964.4828
He wished to see everything	11.7049
He approached the hole he	560.4522
He planted his torch in	70.1017
In an instant a space	2432.1924
Dants easily recognized them Faria	108.3691
There was no longer any	1160.5100
In an instant he had	1463.0675
Dants seized the handles and	137.0250
He sought to open it	2072.8359
Dants inserted the sharp end	1042.1283
The hinges yielded in their	1371.4290
Edmond was seized with vertigo	209.4812
He then closed his eyes	746.7880
Three compartments divided the coffer	19.1456
In the first blazed piles	4639.7124
After having touched felt examined	2586.5220
He was alonealone with these	79.7823
Was he awake or was	28.2433
Was it a transient vision	111.6980
He would fain have gazed	1016.4097
This time he fell on	1000.5458
He soon became calmer and	520.8818
He then set himself to	37.6563
There were a thousand ingots	2846.8027
and his predecessors and he	100.9380
And he measured ten double	2890.5815
Dants saw the light gradually	951.7552
A piece of biscuit and	1953.3479
It was a night of	1451.3364
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Unknown Day for which	734.0058
With the first light Dants	27.9161
Again he climbed the rocky	2085.8386
Descending into the grotto he	1610.3115
This done he impatiently awaited	47.9442
To wait at Monte Cristo	1329.0298
On the sixth day the	23.3494
From a distance Dants recognized	2317.8701
He then inquired how they	63.8063
To this question the smugglers	1643.4452
This obliged them to make	1076.9003
In fact the pursuing vessel	1981.4359
Upon the whole however the	2345.0583
Edmond preserved the most admirable	1638.4203
Arrived at Leghorn he repaired	1116.1665
Dants half feared that such	1617.3080
The following day Dants presented	2864.0457
Jacopo could scarcely believe his	1235.1704
The superior education of Dants	1573.6592
The term for which Edmond	2003.8386
The following morning Jacopo set	1378.4080
Having seen Jacopo fairly out	4205.2842
To the captain he promised	383.4145
Then Dants departed for Genoa	17.4752
At the moment of his	1031.6427
Dants struck with the beauty	1194.4352
The proposal was too advantageous	854.3162
A bargain was therefore struck	15.3680
Dants led the owner of	725.0875
The delighted builder then offered	2312.3826
The builder cheerfully undertook the	2556.2188
Two hours afterward Dants sailed	3255.8765
But their wonder was soon	987.8988
The boat indeed seemed to	2040.5858
The spectators followed the little	1439.5059
Some insisted she was making	1636.9998
Yet thither it was that	560.4960
Dants had carefully noted the	1311.7986
The island was utterly deserted	1780.0131
Early on the following morning	1450.7074
A week passed by <PAD>	9.9635
Dants employed it in manuvring	2367.6526
The former Dants proposed to	65.3920
Upon the eighth day he	409.4734
As it drew near he	132.7780
He immediately signalled it <PAD>	11.6131
His signal was returned and	542.7832
A mournful answer awaited each	557.1580
Old Dants was dead and	24.9595
Dants listened to these melancholy	3647.7339
In a couple of hours	19.6389
Two of the men from	1130.2318
For his fathers death he	814.0165
Without divulging his secret Dants	299.3421
There were besides other particulars	1124.0586
His lookingglass had assured him	1668.2308
One fine morning then his	2538.5317
Still Dants could not view	1193.6592
The first person to attract	831.2217
Edmond welcomed the meeting with	1448.3442
Going straight towards him he	2219.6946
Giving the sailor a piece	1377.9564
Dants instantly turned to meet	16.1201
I beg your pardon sir	1033.3126
I see that I have	924.8511
Some nabob from India was	34.2405
Dants meanwhile went on his	16.5041
Each step he trod oppressed	2131.5916
And thus he proceeded onwards	1482.3522
At this spot so pregnant	3279.9829
Recovering himself however he wiped	802.0577
The nasturtiums and other plants	1377.2588
Leaning against the tree he	707.7405
Then he advanced to the	151.3779
Though answered in the negative	969.8487
The tenants of the humble	1539.7252
Nothing in the two small	683.5559
The bed belonging to the	791.9891
The young couple gazed with	1702.5311
When he withdrew from the	1574.5516
As Edmond passed the door	1472.4690
Having obtained the address of	1324.2178
The very same day the	647.3339
This strange event aroused great	2062.6155
But what raised public astonishment	1430.0481
But on the following day	1039.2249
The delighted recipients of these	3853.8184
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Pont du Gard Inn	2924.4526
This modern place of entertainment	1079.7292
It also boasted of what	1523.2527
A few dingy olives and	18217.5664
Between these sickly shrubs grew	7512.1094
All these trees great or	1042.0394
In the surrounding plain which	5488.2876
Each stalk served as a	5512.7114
For about seven or eight	1029.1521
This small staff was quite	3491.2705
And as though to add	3335.4753
The innkeeper himself was a	1968.6954
His naturally dark complexion had	2092.8403
This man was our old	38.2538
His wife on the contrary	844.1055
Born in the neighborhood of	1204.3412
She remained nearly always in	3085.2195
It is Gods pleasure that	2227.7786
Still let it not be	1015.2369
Like other dwellers in the	2302.5635
During the days of his	607.6890
He dressed in the picturesque	2866.1824
But by degrees watchchains necklaces	33578.7930
Caderousse then was as usual	821.9084
At the moment Caderousse quitted	1143.7629
There it lay stretching out	5044.5796
Nevertheless had Caderousse but retained	1792.6433
The horse was of Hungarian	256.1248
His rider was a priest	1346.3352
Having arrived before the Pont	1209.7008
However that might have been	897.2453
Availing himself of a handle	1623.0374
At this unusual sound a	5645.2129
At that moment a heavy	1328.5558
You are welcome sir most	69.6737
Now then Margotin cried he	107.3732
Pray dont heed him sirhe	126.5872
I make no doubt a	1759.5806
I really did not observe	255.8683
What would the abb please	15.4220
What refreshment can I offer	14.8062
All I have is at	886.8255
YesChristian and surname are the	14.1124
You formerly lived I believe	1192.4690
It is so hot at	1389.4740
But talking of heat is	958.9620
Upon issuing forth from his	1804.4457
Are you quite alone inquired	453.0472
Quite quite alone replied the	808.9872
Ah sir said Caderousse with	465.7811
Yes honestI can certainly say	2011.4417
In the first place I	501.4034
Did I know poor dear	15.1767
Why Edmond Dants and myself	2613.3262
You remind me said the	446.3942
Why he was so called	1002.7237
Did you know him <PAD>	7.1129
Is he alive and at	14.5392
Is he prosperous and happy	2420.6860
Poor fellow poor fellow murmured	21.1538
Well there sir is another	1101.3506
Ah continued Caderousse speaking in	798.7556
Why does not God if	1026.9907
And so I did replied	260.6049
But I swear to you	585.0515
You knew the poor lad	30.8185
I was called to see	781.3082
Of what think you do	1879.2922
But the strangest part of	878.8310
How should he have been	15.0424
Ah sir the poor fellow	745.2559
A rich Englishman continued the	976.1907
Instead of employing this diamond	1373.5670
To one in Edmonds position	93.6497
It was estimated at fifty	321.4768
Surely the diamond was as	480.4390
I have it with me	1582.8450
Calmly drawing forth from his	1217.3140
And that diamond cried Caderousse	1653.7803
But how comes the diamond	37.4613
Did Edmond make you his	127.2585
I once possessed four dear	887.1427
The name of one of	105.9673
Another of the number continued	633.9633
The third of my friends	1691.6429
True said the abb with	210.2751
Bring me a carafe of	29.3926
Caderousse quickly performed the strangers	3409.4033
You will go to Marseilles	393.5816
Do you understand Perfectly You	1780.6157
The fifth sharer in Edmonds	5611.7344
Can you enlighten me on	293.3105
Why I lived almost on	80.3851
Ah yes about a year	973.0407
Of what asked the priest	29.2007
Why of downright starvation Starvation	184.6674
Why the vilest animals are	173.9433
The very dogs that wander	2592.6887
Oh it is impossibleutterly impossible	109.2040
And you are a fool	367.3860
Why should you meddle with	1081.1455
Mind your own business wife	42.8663
This gentleman asks me for	3689.7996
What have you to do	43.8043
Better study a little common	22.9976
How do you know the	744.4922
Nothing is easier than to	2186.7583
Whatever evils may befall you	2257.6650
Again the abb had been	1065.4600
When he had sufficiently recovered	710.1478
Surely had not such been	545.9329
Gaspard Gaspard murmured the woman	1051.1395
But Dants was so honorable	673.6005
Poor Edmond he was cruelly	783.6735
And whatever people may say	2177.2061
Do you then know in	184.0166
Do I <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	4.5119
No one better Speak out	1184.5948
Why what good would it	23.8392
If the poor lad were	725.1033
But you tell me he	546.2219
You say truly the gift	1303.6826
no more than a drop	1772.1090
Are these persons then so	296.7124
Pray relate it to me	905.6988
I shall do my duty	349.8216
My first business will be	989.7934
Wife wife cried he in	1409.9753
It is a beautiful diamond	1013.2724
The jewel is worth at	982.2186
The fifth part of the	470.2821
It does replied the abb	953.1808
As being the friends Edmond	1507.9541
Of course not rejoined Caderousse	700.6648
I said I looked upon	2301.9983
You will have the goodness	495.6635
As he saw the abb	686.0523
There you see wife said	1192.4872
For my part I wash	1222.4888
Arrived at the top stair	1739.5892
La Carconte then entered her	2744.8179
Well asked the abb as	511.5449
I certainly think you act	93.9578
Not because I have the	765.3478
I am all attention said	16.7597
Stop a minute answered Caderousse	840.3220
During this time the abb	122.9463
He removed his seat into	772.7302
Remember this is no affair	774.4008
Enough enough replied Caderousse say	774.1889
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Story First sir said	448.6693
Why if you ever make	534.4619
I am a priest and	54.4959
Recollect our only desire is	407.3014
Speak then without reserve as	863.0193
Well then under these circumstances	681.3853
Oh yes I can see	730.1547
Dants himself only knew that	1010.6552
The old man returned alone	1324.5070
The next day Mercds came	1071.2103
No was the old mans	843.6282
Ah sir replied Caderousse we	687.3775
One night however I heard	628.7875
I can not now repeat	778.3958
From day to day he	86.6743
M Morrel and Mercds came	389.4866
One day when contrary to	856.8337
At length the poor old	1239.0743
I know this because the	121.4411
For the first three days	424.8458
I then resolved to go	53.5370
The door was closed but	874.0921
They both came immediately M	969.5601
I was there too and	224.8554
From that time he received	638.2784
The story interests you does	55.6215
Yes replied the abb it	843.6846
This was M Morrels wish	1059.0337
Mercds remained therefore by his	767.4235
And you believe he died	108.3688
I am as certain of	782.7238
This was indeed a horrid	80.2890
The more so sir as	692.9653
Tell me therefore who are	1208.3247
Speak on They denounced Edmond	310.6786
Which was the real delinquent	725.4658
Oh Faria Faria how well	902.0809
Nothing nothing replied the priest	820.5879
I had only an indistinct	92.1860
I said all that a	401.2991
If he should really be	478.0614
It was cowardly I confess	1134.6095
I often ask pardon of	710.9999
I am expiating a moment	1861.1595
Well sir said the abb	1312.0056
But he knows it all	994.6510
You have two or three	513.4885
The part of an honest	102.4169
Twenty times he interceded for	19.8292
When the emperor returned he	1384.8999
Ten times as I told	503.6871
I have the purse still	1159.1539
In that case replied the	678.6658
Yes happy as myself said	13.0514
What <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8407
M Morrel unhappy exclaimed the	16.3931
He is reduced almost to	1068.2864
If this ship founders like	1328.1708
Yes he has a wife	769.1057
If he were alone in	1000.5877
And it is thus heaven	90.3309
You see I who never	839.4409
Why he left Marseilles and	702.6448
During the war with Spain	612.8080
He is a millionaire and	426.0525
Who can answer for that	10.2928
Happiness or unhappiness is the	1371.8770
Why much the same story	1288.1251
I confess this staggers me	79.2355
There must have been in	977.2754
Some days before the return	65.8456
The Bourbons left him quietly	2311.6187
I went too but as	811.4235
Fernand was enrolled in the	801.3558
The night after that battle	799.1392
That same night the general	52.0886
He proposed to Fernand to	574.2065
Fernand would have been courtmartialed	1036.2865
He returned to France with	551.2099
Fernand was a Spaniard and	1076.1010
destiny murmured the abb <PAD>	8.4996
Yes but listen this was	16.0370
The war with Spain being	4983.2227
Greece only had risen against	1701.6221
The French government without protecting	484.5510
Fernand sought and obtained leave	1050.0585
Some time after it was	548.9088
Ali Pasha was killed as	859.1064
So that now continued Caderousse	68.2140
Rue du Helder Paris The	1616.9194
Mercds is at this moment	99.4753
Go on said the abb	202.5889
But I have seen things	1212.3566
I have told you of	399.0646
In the midst of her	83.9085
This was the departure of	887.4901
Fernand went and Mercds remained	16.3668
Three months passed and still	1589.0416
One evening after a day	1309.7059
Suddenly she heard a step	806.9796
It was not the one	433.9066
Mercds seized Fernands hands with	1078.9058
And then it must be	380.3366
Another possessed all Mercds heart	182.6989
At this last thought Mercds	1246.3999
Fernand saw this and when	93.7130
He was now a lieutenant	10.5049
At his first coming he	406.4324
Mercds begged for six months	765.2982
What more could the most	1731.3512
Fernand more happy but not	828.9094
There were too many unpleasant	2540.4377
Yes during the Spanish war	1186.0282
Her son said he <PAD>	7.5042
Yes replied Caderousse little Albert	974.2985
I understood from Edmond that	1136.2094
Mercds might have been a	504.1254
Fernands fortune was already waxing	183.0635
She learned drawing musiceverything <PAD>	15.2346
Besides I believe between ourselves	971.9440
But now her position in	1487.0154
And yet what asked the	13.8284
Yet I am sure she	36.3459
What makes you believe this	1622.0811
So I went to Danglars	44.0378
I called on Fernand who	852.9343
Oh he never was a	274.3220
I only as you see	875.9191
Edmond had one friend only	61.1838
Take the diamond then and	799.4441
Take it then but in	140.4981
The abb smiled <PAD> <PAD>	7.8691
In exchange he continued give	1180.5089
The abb took it and	51.9014
Oh you are a man	533.7437
Well he said all you	650.2063
I will swear to you	858.8647
Tis well and may this	25.5540
Adieu I go far from	1615.4366
When Caderousse turned around he	416.3938
Is then all that I	51.6256
What <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8407
That he has given the	718.3735
See here it is The	856.3751
False he muttered <PAD> <PAD>	6.7319
False <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
Why should that man give	1609.5101
Oh he said taking up	935.8868
Look after the house wife	470.0189
Fifty thousand francs muttered La	842.2745
The Prison Register The day	1132.5938

Rue de Nouailles he has	1317.0156
M de Boville was in	800.8683
As to M de Boville	507.4800
The Englishman with the coolness	1185.9224
Oh sir exclaimed M de	1105.9585
I had two hundred thousand	1154.4323
I had informed M Morrel	839.8465
The Englishman appeared to reflect	1023.9917
Our house added the Englishman	1036.9153
A ray of joy passed	1739.6556
They have perhaps some motive	256.9478
But all I know sir	638.0803
I only ask a brokerage	325.4515
The commission is usually one	557.1057
Whatever you say Sir replied	841.6851
I have since learned that	778.5161
Oh dear yes sir the	1864.4132
Yes replied M de Boville	602.2278
That man made a deep	666.0487
And you say sir he	1231.7966
It appears sir that this	1161.9503
He no doubt thought that	1845.8096
As I have already told	726.9687
Do you not comprehend No	1466.7466
Well they fastened a thirtysixpound	686.2241
Yes sir continued the inspector	21.5918
You may imagine the amazement	522.7524
I should like to have	1026.2134
So can I said the	400.7392
Yes yes the mortuary deposition	17.5711
You understand Dants relations if	1299.2870
He is dead and no	1287.5521
But to return to these	327.2635
Excuse me Excuse you for	13.8481
For the story <PAD> <PAD>	6.3410
By no means it really	92.7049
So sir you wish to	825.7814
Everything was here arranged in	971.7253
The inspector begged the Englishman	1250.2023
The Englishman easily found the	988.6929
There he found everything arranged	1930.9489
He folded up the accusation	806.9080
Then he saw through the	18.3019
This petition to Napoleon kept	1435.0593
He was no longer astonished	1052.8170
An inveterate Bonapartist took an	284.3697

Cocles remained in M Morrels	705.1080
He was however the same	1216.9286
In the midst of the	238.9507
But this did not arise	316.4179
Like the rats that one	2017.9224
Cocles had seen them go	150.3561
Everything was as we have	651.8961
Nothing had as yet occurred	2171.3721

The Englishman entered and found	1386.9923

Morrel rose and advanced to	298.1949
The two men remained opposite	1332.9572
The noise had ceased but	822.3455
The stranger fancied he heard	952.3485
A key was inserted in	389.6692
There are only two persons	772.8297
Morrel rose tremblingly supporting himself	75.9928
He would have spoken but	34.9336
Oh father said she clasping	2292.0386
Julie threw herself into his	18.1696

How did this happen said	15.3058
Draw nearer Penelon said the	1843.0050
Goodday M Morrel said he	860.8188
Goodday Penelon returned Morrel who	1868.7308

More than that we shall	1008.2051
Take in two reefs in	2814.8657
Penelon put his hand over	878.0598
We did better than that	1069.9269
Eh it was that that	701.3461
Penelon said the captain I	653.3384
All hands to the pumps	673.4701
Ah said I after four	1562.6746

To the boats my lads	1593.1848
The captain descended last or	959.4957

Ten minutes after she pitched	1178.3779
As for us we were	845.3501
There now M Morrel thats	738.3862
Well well said M Morrel	146.0003
It was the will of	97.2270

Cocles pay two hundred francs	122.8399
At another time added he	1037.0428
As for that M Morrel	793.8172
Penelon nearly swallowed his quid	55.1823
What M Morrel said he	618.6613
Then you must not pay	3336.4775
Emmanuel go with them and	954.4147
Yes I hope so at	13.8498

Do you promise I swear	49.1054
Adieu mademoiselle <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0142
Continue to be the good	629.5135
The stranger waved his hand	41.2447
In the court he found	911.9987
Come with me my friend	85.6462
The Fifth of September The	1620.7621
The same day he told	681.5189
Unfortunately however Morrel had not	1472.3672
When he thought the matter	849.6815
The bills signed by Morrel	1630.2228
Cocles thus remained in his	25.0451
It was Morrel alone who	503.3690
The opinion of all the	1197.5382
Great therefore was the astonishment	846.9479
Still confidence was not restored	907.4106
The month passed and Morrel	176.9215
Formerly his paper at any	176.0853
Morrel now tried to negotiate	1140.7705
Fortunately Morrel had some funds	682.3129
The agent of Thomson French	1041.9440
As to the sailors of	780.7306
Captain Gaumard recovered from his	90.7054

The worthy shipowner knew from	2037.8602
He brought him also the	639.0620
As he descended the staircase	90.9159
Penelon had it would seem	253.6653
When he saw his employer	1567.1459
Morrel attributed Penelons embarrassment to	1251.1415
Perhaps he had come to	1110.7256
Worthy fellows said Morrel as	724.6854
On the of August it	479.3687
But contrary to all expectation	1099.4380
There came in moreover two	2169.9385
All this was incomprehensible and	1501.6003
On the Morrel returned he	891.3456
Morrel had thought of Danglars	1342.4222
It was said at this	785.1408
Danglars then without taking a	668.0003
Morrel had long thought of	1183.6462
And Morrel was right for	195.8999
Yet on his arrival Morrel	259.2962
He embraced his weeping wife	2110.9019
Then said the two women	1535.4889
The poor women felt instinctively	603.7315
Besides Maximilian Morrel though hardly	151.5704
He was a strongminded upright	24.6819
At the time when he	702.9066
He had at once declared	2625.7109
For a year he had	227.5994
In his regiment Maximilian Morrel	1672.4442

They had not mistaken the	930.1149
She would have questioned him	1187.7950
Who could ever have believed	2500.9661
Morrel examined the ledgers opened	79.4651
All his funds amounted to	960.5298
He had not even the	109.9837
However when Morrel went down	79.4209
This calmness was more alarming	321.2451
After dinner Morrel usually went	946.1312
As to Cocles he seemed	25.7483
For part of the day	813.6967
Emmanuel tried to comfort the	71.3604
The young man was too	650.8292
Night came the two women	701.9583
They listened he went into	106.5673
Madame Morrel sent her daughter	1579.7037
In the passage she saw	666.1278
The young lady went towards	25.8015
He is writing she said	10.8269
They had understood each other	24.7256
Madame Morrel looked again through	1157.4617
The terrible idea that he	1101.3590
Next day M Morrel seemed	1193.7855
In the evening Julie told	1056.3662
The next two days passed	43.2326
On the evening of the	212.6235
Julie trembled at this request	99.0935
Why did her father ask	870.5826
The young girl looked at	15.8533
What have I done wrong	618.5212
I must have left it	29.7665
And she went out but	282.1865
Do not give this key	551.9503
During the night between the	708.7594
It was three oclock when	47.6795
The mother and daughter passed	26.5177
They had expected Maximilian since	30.8713
At eight oclock in the	50.9462
He was calm but the	340.5960
They did not dare to	53.9751
Morrel was kinder to his	213.2404
He could not cease gazing	86.3106
Julie mindful of Emmanuels request	1300.3798
I wish you to do	15.6026
This was the first time	496.3480
She remained at the same	57.6260
An instant afterwards the door	663.3046
She looked up and uttered	37.5780
Maximilian my dearest brother she	19.0752
At these words Madame Morrel	166.5787
Mother said the young man	512.7593
Your letter has frightened me	1020.4593
Are you not Mademoiselle Julie	149.6193
Yes sir replied Julie with	53.8346
I do not know you	109.3234
Julie hesitated <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9389
It concerns the best interests	61.2352
The young girl hastily took	34.5225
She opened it quickly and	527.9253
ask the porter for the	524.8898
It is important that he	66.4698
You promised to obey me	21.1745
Remember your oath <PAD> <PAD>	7.5807
Sinbad the Sailor The young	1315.4341
She cast her eyes again	677.8749
She read It is important	208.8411
If you go accompanied by	1056.4619
Was there nothing to fear	10.9962
was there not some snare	30.7068
Her innocence had kept her	721.4751
But there is no need	565.1140
Julie hesitated and resolved to	25.2050
Yet through a singular impulse	879.8016
She hastened down and told	690.6396
You must go then mademoiselle	24.1692
Go there murmured Julie <PAD>	10.9422
Yes I will accompany you	202.4118
And you shall be alone	23.7497
I will await you at	641.6841
Did not the messenger say	1517.4320
Emmanuel hesitated a moment but	260.0381
Listen he said today is	795.7261
During this time Madame Morrel	47.0205
The young man knew quite	1404.1429
He was thunderstruck <PAD> <PAD>	7.5818
Then rushing hastily out of	1255.8928
While he was yet at	413.9988
Instead of going direct to	771.2375
Morrel uttered a cry of	296.7877
He remained motionless on the	526.4336
Maximilian sprang down the staircase	1318.5117
Father he exclaimed turning pale	899.8121
Father father in Heavens name	1156.1196
Come and I will explain	748.3154
Morrel opened the door and	662.4417
In this ledger was made	123.1245
Morrel had to pay within	39.7745
All he possessed was francs	11.3170
Read said Morrel <PAD> <PAD>	6.1526
The young man was overwhelmed	24.0095
Morrel said not a word	8.9166
What could he say <PAD>	7.9056
What need he add to	87.5136
And have you done all	841.4443
I have replied Morrel <PAD>	8.1484
You have no money coming	1784.9299
You are right father I	621.7138
Your motheryour sister <PAD> <PAD>	10.2386

You have a calm strong	23.6570
Maximilian you are no ordinary	14.5556

Maximilian smiled <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5824
I know father you are	227.4000

Go to work labor young	2622.9041
Reflect how glorious a day	1143.1981
If on the contrary I	359.4331
Living my best friends would	877.1124
Living you would feel shame	631.4929
And now said Morrel leave	836.9625
A last but final hope	582.6236
Morrel shook his head <PAD>	9.5159
I saw her this morning	1268.4116
Yes my son and a	854.7277
Its agent who will in	745.2775
Let this house be the	365.9956
And now once more adieu	22.9590
Go leave me I would	16.7637
You will find my will	678.7505
Hear me Maximilian said his	12.8914
Suppose I were a soldier	696.5265

After a moments interval Cocles	25.0825
It was no longer the	448.0164
This thoughtthe house of Morrel	1367.9896
My worthy Cocles said Morrel	312.2224
When the gentleman who came	2683.7322
Morrel fell back in his	613.6859
The hand moved on with	164.9113
What passed in the mind	472.6194
He was still comparatively young	1059.0050
To form the slightest idea	1190.9790
The minute hand moved on	14.8443
The pistols were loaded he	478.5710
Then he laid it down	116.7251
It seemed to him as	240.1398
Then he turned again to	233.8853
He took up the deadly	1088.5376
At this moment of mortal	3087.8862
He heard the door of	1944.4758
Morrel did not turn roundhe	1801.0184
Suddenly he heard a cryit	38.0940
He turned and saw Julie	12.3658
The pistol fell from his	17.3459
My father cried the young	1283.4434
Saved my child said Morrel	68.8241
See see said the young	12.2135
Morrel took the purse and	912.0387
At one end was the	496.5336
Morrel passed his hand over	81.4100
At this moment the clock	23.9076

You know the vessel is	124.6951
The Pharaon is entering the	1803.8384

Father cried Maximilian how could	55.5317
The lookout has signalled her	1384.9950
Impossible impossible But what was	1293.7317
Ah sir exclaimed Cocles what	2280.6873
In a moment they were	22.1873
There was a crowd on	17.9430
All the crowd gave way	21.4334
The Pharaon <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.8768

Signor Pastrini replied that he	637.1846
They accepted his offer but	922.7385
As for Franz he remained	1180.3918
One evening he cast off	1214.2512
He traversed the island after	1456.2333
Two hours after he again	550.7834
The sport was bad Franz	1874.8644
Ah if your excellency chose	1207.8724
Well what is this island	1284.2368
A desert island in the	994.4352
No but by browsing the	1196.0566
Upon his answer in the	335.4825
Well asked he what now	9.9610
Is there any difficulty in	689.6224
That puts a different face	30.0923
Six days <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4198
Why thats as long as	73.0768
Too long a waittoo long	836.7159
Nor I nor I chorused	21.9007
Then steer for Monte Cristo	1296.2542
Franz waited until all was	917.3940
Gaetano said he to the	736.9500
Has not your excellency heard	3499.3640
Now this rock it has	1396.8678
Yes why Because in the	1458.7484

First one gunl goes under	35.0300
Then they lift and sink	109.0872
All at once theres a	278.5289
Soon the water rushes out	2442.7925
Do you understand now said	867.5566
He was one of those	1428.6720
Calm and resolute he treated	2878.5312
Bah said he I have	1325.0256

Fortunately the mariners were used	1310.5649
An hour had passed since	760.3055
What is this light asked	12.4027
Hush said the captain it	492.9788
It is for that reason	462.0649
It seems to me rather	1090.8119
If you can guess the	386.5949
How can you find out	1576.3508
The pilot again changed the	1165.3267

All this was done in	389.6623
Gaetano who had proposed the	882.6540

During this time the captain	1737.4132
This track soon disappeared it	114.4029
Everyone on board remained motionless	1495.3518
Well exclaimed Franz and the	27.9408
They are Spanish smugglers said	1562.5271
Very often the bandits are	1827.0214
This costs us nothing and	1034.7711
Then you know the men	983.9169
It is not their fault	778.9754
I mean that they have	285.5972
Well said the young man	152.7522
Do you think they will	1874.9045

Gaetano skirted the light carefully	1134.4098
At the first words of	997.8676
They soon appeared satisfied and	632.3354
When the boat was within	995.8056
Franz coolly cocked both barrels	25.9491
Gaetano then exchanged a few	693.5940
Will your excellency give your	104.6047
My name must rest unknown	1973.0034
Not a word was spoken	1489.9795
The man who had disappeared	431.1610
The sailors did not wait	1873.7687
One of his guns was	1212.7283
The boat was moored to	1226.9381
They advanced about thirty paces	2020.6212
Around in the crevices of	752.3329
Franz lowered a torch and	622.2530
As for his suspicions once	1323.2583
He mentioned this to Gaetano	872.7086
Besides added he if the	1088.8351
Franz waited impatiently inhaling the	913.3269
Well said Franz anything newdo	1152.6611
Has he built one here	690.1639
Ah replied he guessing Franzs	750.2659
What do they say That	1899.9637
It is no nonsense it	27.7367
Cama the pilot of the	1541.8390
Gaetano departed with the reply	11.7364
Franz was prudent and wished	178.1992
He turned towards the sailor	1377.3357
Never mind that returned the	770.8522
She is what the English	832.1902
No but Gaetano did I	697.0737
He was accompanied by two	37.5557
Franz drew his handkerchief from	223.5928
Without uttering a word they	1340.4304
Afterwards he was made to	267.6887
He promised <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.7410
Then his two guides took	514.1003
After going about thirty paces	1726.1439
Presently by a change in	728.5483
At length his feet touched	1087.8973
There was a moments silence	929.0581
I beg you will remove	1329.0457
Although of a paleness that	1210.5172
His pallor was so peculiar	1090.3204
He was not particularly tall	934.1827
But what astonished Franz who	1069.7953
The entire chamber was lined	327.2270
In a recess was a	2001.5515
The host gave Franz time	1212.0808
Sir he said after a	947.1464
Let me now endeavor to	1287.3636
I have always observed that	2826.4448
I may say with Lucullus	692.2615
But such as is my	768.6441
Ali is the supper ready	1435.4788
Now said the unknown to	326.1760
Pray observe that I too	375.6526
I only request you to	202.8842
As for myself that I	550.7687
That will keep us from	1114.2612
Franz now looked upon another	1584.2820
The diningroom was scarcely less	1783.5797
These baskets contained four pyramids	13830.2256
The supper consisted of a	5544.2773
Between these large dishes were	179.3945
The dishes were of silver	104.7477
Franz rubbed his eyes in	133.1301
Ali alone was present to	1443.3823
Yes replied he while he	719.5995
He remembers that I saved	964.4741
Would it be impertinent Signor	1242.2631
It seems the fellow had	2344.9690
I always had a desire	744.0706
He hesitated a moment he	239.6592
But when I added to	1310.9449
This was a useless clause	1670.0519
And like the celebrated sailor	813.4647
I made a vow at	581.1073
You have suffered a great	62.9400
Sinbad started and looked fixedly	1710.7382
I am king of all	16.4535
I am pleased with one	663.0886
Sometimes I amuse myself by	395.8166
Then I have my mode	2468.0671
Ah if you had tasted	695.7936
The unknown fixed on the	807.1354
And why revenge he asked	13.0043
Because replied Franz you seem	951.5714
You have not guessed rightly	14.2340
Such as you see me	427.9795
I must seem to you	468.1112
Then Ali brought on the	809.6981
Between the two baskets he	209.1078
The care with which Ali	262.5097
He raised the cover and	2019.8149
He replaced the lid as	630.9160
You can not guess said	705.4434
Are you a man for	66.7876
taste this and the mines	168.3014
Are you a man of	22.1484
taste this and the boundaries	1474.9988
Are you ambitious and do	89.2265
taste this and in an	513.1206
Is it not tempting what	493.8159
look At these words he	2226.4194
Franz did not disturb him	1259.2947
In this valley were magnificent	799.7545
Into these pavilions he admitted	4454.2808
What these happy persons took	1249.0105
I know thatby name at	3978.1089
Like everything else we must	1335.8446
There is a struggle in	1519.7739
Nature subdued must yield in	1598.7982
But what changes occur <PAD>	13.5594
It is only by comparing	1068.1846
When you return to this	1589.7760
Taste the hashish guest of	1903.4478
Diable he said after having	47.5451
I do not know if	605.7139
Tell me the first time	2881.6748
Could you comprehend how the	1474.3512
Eh <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8433

Well it is the same	482.3971

It was simply yet richly	26.0499
It was round and a	61.2820
Divan walls ceiling floor were	4542.5361
Both laid themselves down on	4345.9468
Each of them took one	172.6432
There was a moments silence	1278.3824
Ali brought in the coffee	11.1649
How do you take it	2237.3374
As you please it is	454.4692
And you are right said	339.5598
Ah those Orientals they are	98.9549
As for me he added	510.4679
Well unfurl your wings and	2205.9438
As to Franz a strange	56.0131
All the bodily fatigue of	572.7827
His body seemed to acquire	3971.4185
At length the boat touched	1552.0930
He descended or rather seemed	2238.1057
They were the same statues	1799.6174
They were Phryne Cleopatra Messalina	136.6053
Then among them glided like	2353.1682
Then the three statues advanced	1003.9781

He thought himself in a	393.8037
He stretched forth his hand	1183.4803
The vision had fled and	1015.4641
He advanced several paces towards	857.3700
He found that he was	697.1848
The air and water were	1308.5636
There for some time he	820.0934
He was for some time	1097.0693
He recalled his arrival on	2089.5527
It seemed however even in	803.4203
Thus every now and then	1062.6389
Otherwise his head was perfectly	905.3084
He went gayly up to	922.6091
Franz adjusted his telescope and	69.5640
Gaetano was not mistaken <PAD>	8.0608
At the stern the mysterious	843.8885
He was attired as he	866.3586

Franz took the lamp and	102.6330
He recognized the place where	633.9017
He saw nothing unless that	1002.3245
Yet he did not leave	1733.1816
All was vain and he	345.7782
At the end of this	113.8386
When Franz appeared again on	795.3054
He looked again through his	154.0735
Gaetano reminded him that he	477.0083
He took his fowlingpiece and	691.0962

Precisely so replied Gaetano <PAD>	10.0270
Ah he is one who	1703.2505
And what cares he for	167.3922
He smiles at them <PAD>	9.6498
Let them try to pursue	16.3114
Why in the first place	902.1230
As to Franz he had	122.9043

The man of superior abilities	164.5515
He was spoken of as	1403.1055
And yet the two young	1985.4431
Only their wish to see	952.8382
Teresa was sixteen and Vampa	21.0911
About this time a band	1329.9465
The brigands have never been	123.4563
Sometimes a chief is wanted	1033.8726
The celebrated Cucumetto pursued in	1707.7006
He strove to collect a	2211.0945
Many young men of Palestrina	78.4430
Their disappearance at first caused	586.9521
After some time Cucumetto became	3293.3635
One day he carried off	190.9966
The bandits laws are positive	2150.0972
When their parents are sufficiently	1750.5173
The young girls lover was	138.1866
When she recognized her lover	1436.4854
However as he was a	541.6436
He took Cucumetto one side	1041.7452
There he told the chief	1659.6799
It so happened that night	729.0526
Cucumetto had been there however	188.3815
Carlini besought his chief to	1406.0189
Cucumetto seemed to yield to	1451.0492
Carlini flew joyfully to Rita	1681.9628
Twelve hours delay was all	183.2554
The instant the letter was	389.3507
He found a young shepherd	38.9918
The natural messengers of the	1724.9147
The boy undertook the commission	301.2598
Carlini returned anxious to see	109.5916
He found the troop in	2515.6309
He inquired where they were	89.0855
A cold perspiration burst from	207.4885
He repeated his question <PAD>	9.6226
One of the bandits rose	1206.3730
After a hundred yards he	807.9518
At the sight of Carlini	91.7268
The two brigands looked at	962.6523
A terrible battle between the	2718.3093
Rita lay between them <PAD>	10.4804
The moon lighted the group	15.6473
Well said Cucumetto have you	125.6069
At nine oclock tomorrow Ritas	889.1577
Now as I am not	1110.6610
Why should an exception be	923.8902
Now then said Cucumetto advancing	1574.3481
He was standing his arms	141.5633
Cucumetto fancied for a moment	565.3000
He continued to follow the	876.7625
Let us draw lots <PAD>	12.4649
let us draw lots cried	135.7056
Their demand was fair and	168.8291
The eyes of all shone	978.3235
The names of all including	1464.9998
He was the man who	678.5874
A large wound extending from	205.1253
Diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored	157.2337
Captain said he just now	823.4434
Then sitting down by the	1647.8435
Carlini ate and drank as	42.1090
The bandits looked on with	241.5656
They turned round and saw	131.6590
Her head hung back and	85.9173
As they entered the circle	868.6664
This apparition was so strange	1414.3712
Diavolaccio advanced amidst the most	266.6738
Then everyone could understand the	275.0503
A knife was plunged up	118.4422
Everyone looked at Carlini the	76.9751
Ah ah said the chief	3071.0320
No other of the bandits	428.2982
Now then cried Carlini rising	580.1667
Cucumetto placed his sentinels for	1038.7166
At midnight the sentinel gave	212.0418
It was Ritas father who	93.8904
Here said he to Cucumetto	189.0784
But the chief without taking	97.3894
The old man obeyed <PAD>	9.9427
They both advanced beneath the	193.3447
Cucumetto stopped at last and	247.5694
There said he demand thy	687.1523
The old man remained motionless	471.3069
At length he advanced toward	162.0748
As he approached Carlini raised	758.4024
A woman lay on the	634.8036
The old man recognized his	76.9763
I expected thee said the	45.1316
Wretch returned the old man	1548.0072
A ray of moonlight poured	259.8475
Cucumetto had violated thy daughter	1413.7576
Now continued Carlini if I	1818.6121
Thou hast done well returned	1976.1849
These were the first tears	68.5583
Now said the old man	958.5875
When the grave was formed	655.5000
Then they knelt on each	156.4242
Then when they had finished	333.8002
Then extending his hand the	826.1921
Leave me I command you	1411.1699
It had been resolved the	73.7320
An hour before daybreak Cucumetto	210.3752
But Carlini would not quit	286.4096
He went toward the place	35.4696
He found the old man	693.3453
He then took an oath	614.0146
But he was unable to	1388.6493
There was some surprise however	436.3133
That astonishment ceased when one	2377.2322
On the morning of the	540.2635
They told ten other stories	296.0177
Thus from Fondi to Perusia	141.6866
These narratives were frequently the	151.3327
The young girl trembled very	1783.8196
Time passed on and the	983.1956
They were both orphans and	787.8320
One day when they were	1291.0472
When he came within hearing	1378.3501
Vampa without saying a word	902.4625
Instantly afterwards four carbineers on	1002.7266
The three carbineers looked about	1351.5828
They had seen no one	10.2649
That is very annoying said	693.2809
Yes replied the brigadier and	1034.2408
The brigadier had a moments	18.1581
Five hundred Roman crowns are	2263.8865
Yes it is very annoying	1084.2427
Vampa then removed the stone	40.2948
Through the crevices in the	827.1689
He had read in the	990.9192
But Vampa raised his head	1310.5555
Cucumetto was a cunning fiend	891.9723
Several days elapsed and they	86.2503
The time of the Carnival	18.7584
The Count of SanFelice announced	979.2458
Teresa had a great desire	29.5913
Luigi asked permission of his	572.3914
This was granted <PAD> <PAD>	7.3202
The ball was given by	455.4789
Carmela was precisely the age	262.6818
On the evening of the	1308.9093
Luigi wore the very picturesque	194.4599
They both mingled as they	111.6902
The festa was magnificent not	3338.5242
At each crosspath was an	3995.0120
Carmela was attired like a	33.1186
Her cap was embroidered with	1856.2972
Two of her companions were	472.7503
Four young men of the	1338.5073
They were attired as peasants	183.9024
We need hardly add that	1648.9778
Carmela wished to form a	107.9154
Carmela looked all around her	543.5574
The Count of SanFelice pointed	843.3129
Will you allow me father	21.1620
Certainly replied the count are	638.0292
The young man looked bowed	1169.8190
Teresa felt a flush pass	684.5932
Luigi slowly relinquished Teresas arm	2687.2588
Certainly in the eyes of	867.6716
Luigi felt a sensation hitherto	82.3688
It was like an acute	806.0074
He followed with his eye	1040.8148
When they spoke although Teresa	1763.7463
Then fearing that his paroxysm	951.5828
Luigi was jealous <PAD> <PAD>	7.5864
He felt that influenced by	340.6285
The young peasant girl at	191.7964
We have said that Teresa	1016.3510
She had almost all the	781.6365
And with overpowering compliments her	1505.0354
Twice or thrice during the	841.2562
Thus it was almost tremblingly	86.3231
The quadrille had been most	1724.0668
One of the cavaliers then	851.4876
The truth was that Luigi	1121.7262
Teresa had yielded in spite	715.6694
She herself was not exempt	3003.2466
Why she did not know	451.3107
However to Teresas great astonishment	808.1575
When the chill of the	684.9406
Do you desire it as	814.6882
As Luigi spoke thus he	23.8770
Teresa followed him with her	565.3321
That night a memorable event	1726.5826
The Villa of SanFelice took	567.2839
Awakened in the night by	679.9433
She then returned to her	1065.1003
When she recovered her father	33.8539
All the servants surrounded her	36.3813
An entire wing of the	1484.4338
Her preserver was everywhere sought	844.7634
Carmela was greatly troubled that	49.2781
As the count was immensely	1704.6017
The next day at the	337.1208
Luigi arrived first <PAD> <PAD>	7.1678
He came toward Teresa in	687.5726
The young girl was very	1597.3092
Luigi took her arm beneath	155.3843
Then he paused <PAD> <PAD>	7.1759
The young girl perceiving that	148.3805
Teresa said Luigi yesterday evening	575.5152
Go into the grotto and	1376.9731
Teresa uttered a cry of	2582.7349
Luigi pushed the stone behind	1694.9946
When he saw Luigi he	175.2917
Luigi was not mistaken <PAD>	8.0534
The traveller who was going	953.3413
Luigi threw his cloak on	1585.2462
In ten minutes Luigi and	64.0617
On arriving there with an	761.1871
That is your road excellency	979.0104
Thank you said Luigi drawing	895.9486
Luigi Vampa replied the shepherd	523.4716
And yours I said the	376.9436
Sinbad the Sailor he said	9.3081
Yes replied the narrator that	572.6089
The name of Sinbad the	754.3737
Proceed said he to the	9.8990
Vampa put the two sequins	487.1566
As he came within two	350.3640
He listened to know whence	47.6543
A moment afterwards he thought	108.8579
The cry proceeded from the	17.9321
He bounded like a chamois	1221.5249
Three cries for help came	62.9476
He cast his eyes around	1240.4583
This man who was hastening	599.9772
Vampa measured the distance the	502.2053
The young shepherd stopped as	738.5249
The ravisher stopped suddenly his	449.8780
The young girl rose instantly	454.7133
Vampa then rushed towards Teresa	1017.1825
Fortunately she was unscathed and	134.9528
When Luigi had assured himself	356.6814
He had just expired with	976.1162
His eyes remained open and	19.2826
Vampa approached the corpse and	23.7247
From the day on which	725.3980
From that time he had	769.0998
Vampa gazed on him for	1727.0463
Suddenly Vampa turned toward his	83.3440
You are dressed it is	998.6506
Vampa took Cucumettos body in	1086.3888
If a second traveller had	2785.1936
He would no doubt have	718.9571
At the end of a	879.2799
He wore a vest of	5081.3867
Teresa uttered a cry of	16.4562
Vampa in this attire resembled	235.5124
He had assumed the entire	32.7470
The young man saw the	539.2500
Now he said to Teresa	682.6550
And follow me wherever I	1091.9152
They went towards the forest	33.6240
We need scarcely say that	1003.9891
At the end of this	130.1378
A torrent whose bed was	145.1407
Vampa took this wild road	3060.5212
Teresa had become alarmed at	1347.8049
Suddenly about ten paces from	437.8986
Not another step he said	694.4041
I am Luigi Vampa shepherd	1315.6128
At the end of ten	112.8647
The two young persons obeyed	14.5248
Then the bandit thrice imitated	369.6556
Good said the sentry you	1377.5065
The retreat of Rocca Bianca	1434.3157
Teresa and Luigi reached the	396.9080
Here is a young man	134.0901
What has he to say	198.4490
I wish to say that	197.8489
Ah I understand said the	2648.3396
Yes but I came to	611.8229
I come to ask to	44.7458
The bandits shouted with laughter	18.2279
And what have you done	98.4848
I have killed your chief	1757.0016
The explanation would be too	80.7475
And you say that Signor	1236.0736
They seek for him in	447.2473
his plan is very simple	13.5165
It depends on the distance	1258.5342
At the sixtieth minute of	1039.6061
Excellencies said he the coach	1164.1198
Ah my dear fellow said	1571.7079
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Colosseum Franz had so	1308.6996
The road selected was a	1404.2963
This itinerary possessed another great	2638.9922
Seated with folded arms in	710.5380
One fact more than the	737.3500
The very name assumed by	962.7956
But however the mind of	757.1197
The carriage stopped near the	1706.4088
The usual guide from the	1535.4515
It may therefore be easily	1786.3196
Thus then the young men	2026.9131
Franz had already made seven	2156.9414
Scarcely therefore had the reflective	1752.3463
Franz had remained for nearly	1043.8894
All at once his ear	1079.3647
There was nothing remarkable in	1595.3225
Conjecture soon became certainty for	1654.8848
The stranger thus presenting himself	1772.9855
And his appearance had nothing	981.9896
By a sort of instinctive	369.9681
About ten feet from the	875.9734
Around this opening which had	2003.4976
The person whose mysterious arrival	1476.6653
He wore a large brown	3090.0544
The lower part of his	1317.1726
From the imperfect means Franz	936.6472
Some few minutes had elapsed	1656.7535
The man who had performed	497.8577
I beg your excellencys pardon	1375.6646
But even if you had	672.6606
You are a provident person	279.7400
Perhaps some of these days	1056.9980
One of the culprits will	1108.7407
The other sufferer is sentenced	990.2683
But mark the distinction with	751.8251
I should hate and despise	1434.0619
I will so advantageously bestow	2670.4460
What did your excellency say	25.2396
I said my good fellow	521.7681
Leave me then to act	822.2463
Take what precautions you please	750.4022
Is not a day divided	2960.3943
Now in seconds very many	1236.9886
I have engaged the three	1406.2080
His dress will procure him	802.9210
Well then only fulfil your	1901.6097
Adieu your excellency depend upon	1329.4430
The next minute Franz heard	1393.7520
Franz however did not obey	1089.6661
In ten minutes after the	1801.4153
Franz let him proceed without	771.5884
One of the two men	1154.4950
It was more especially when	2098.4993
And the more he thought	542.6965
As we have seen therefore	2064.3875
In vain did Franz endeavor	2225.4153
Slumber refused to visit his	1192.2063
Worn out at length he	272.6995
Like a genuine Frenchman Albert	1595.2792
At five oclock Albert returned	1083.7511
Yes in a single day	732.9332
Neither had he neglected to	747.7294
The opera of Parisina was	1643.5636
The young men therefore had	1101.5753
Albert had never been able	927.8481
Still in spite of this	2049.4419
Sometimes Albert would affect to	996.2083
And the thing was so	981.8927
Alas poor Albert <PAD> <PAD>	7.1706
None of those interesting adventures	1851.2244
Yet he could not restrain	1121.1914
Albert besides being an elegant	2819.4197
It was therefore no small	1507.2949
Albert however hoped to indemnify	2108.4583
The Carnival was to commence	1345.5016
With this design he had	974.8835
The box taken by Albert	1525.0784
Another motive had influenced Alberts	3344.2505
These united considerations made Albert	437.7618
Totally disregarding the business of	1604.4886
The truth was that the	1005.7529
The actors made their entries	5136.2959
Towards the close of the	684.2313
The quick eye of Albert	1216.0979
And such magnificent hair <PAD>	11.3546
Is she French No a	1388.7334
I was to have been	693.4254
My dear fellow are you	692.8367
Upon my word said Albert	901.3117
Pray tell me is it	169.6859
And in what manner has	1926.4415
All I can say is	771.3313
Are you not going to	938.6466
I believe on my soul	940.2041
How exquisitely Coselli sings his	2259.9517
Did you ever see anything	1311.3307
Franz who had mutely interrogated	1294.7432
This important task was just	182.3949
At the knock the door	589.5869
Franz presented Albert as one	867.7142
Franz added that his companion	1220.9613
The countess in reply bowed	1709.7921
Albert was soon deeply engrossed	1688.3865
Franz perceived how completely he	1074.8512
Sitting alone in the front	1084.6273
Behind her but in deep	1036.3967
Franz could not forbear breaking	1265.0840
All I can tell about	443.1479
Sometimes she is accompanied by	571.3813
The curtain rose on the	1746.9900
The ballet was called Poliska	17.8886
However much the ballet might	1439.3555
Of this he took no	3131.2056
The ballet at length came	1739.0079
Owing to the very judicious	1066.5651
The overture to the second	1536.0396
The countenance of the person	1025.2322
The curtain rose and the	814.2936
Most of my readers are	1443.6797
The injured husband goes through	2307.7451
This duet is one of	1807.4718
Franz now listened to it	1682.9833
Excited beyond his usual calm	1691.7091
The occupant of the box	1180.9042
All doubt of his identity	537.8248
The surprise and agitation occasioned	3285.9597
Countess returned Franz totally unheeding	1871.4158
Do you not know that	310.6129
All I can say is	781.1414
How ghastly pale he is	363.9667
Then you know him almost	26.9685
Oh pray do for heavens	2223.1414
Well inquired Franz after the	809.3422
I must positively find out	211.7086
No no cried the countess	32.9170
I depend upon you to	29.9782
Oh indeed I can not	1364.6499
Byron had the most perfect	622.3990
The description he gave me	311.2986
Oh he is the exact	117.3253
The coalblack hair large bright	3003.6074
Then observe too that the	325.3240
She is a foreignera stranger	13.8342
Nobody knows who she is	45.1191
No doubt she belongs to	1216.2754
I entreat of you not	1927.7032
For that purpose I mean	1032.7806
Listen to me said the	67.0373
I am going home <PAD>	9.8877
I have a party at	641.7055
Now I can not for	939.1753
It was quite evident by	1036.5015
Franz could even feel her	173.2753
Upon arriving at her hotel	1213.5057
Excuse my little subterfuge said	1492.4419
Nay said she do not	667.3035
However promise me one thing	1126.4559
I have more reasons than	927.2374
Well then you must give	665.6245
There are certain affinities between	230.5510
For heavens sake do not	147.8253
Pursue your chase after him	932.3573
And now goodnight go to	382.9590
For my own part I	915.6550
Upon his return to the	1599.4531
My dear fellow cried he	57.2369
Why I did not expect	853.6516
I should have thought the	1168.2152
Why herethey give you their	3199.1931
Why if a Parisian were	1293.0601
Besides you must have perceived	94.8919
At the sight of that	761.2992
Now for my part I	608.7400
I can assure you that	433.5262
Indeed I feel quite sure	1505.8523
He was rather too pale	1278.0911
Well that tends to confirm	2499.7607
Did he speak in your	13.7947
and did you catch any	381.5886
I knew that from the	35.0013
I dont know whether I	1102.5333
Tis he past all doubt	68.3311
But tell me what were	610.0066
Of what nature Why you	779.9686
I tell you what M	1106.8274
I dare say such a	1614.6281
The cart must be tastefully	2052.4395
It would add greatly to	1146.4084
Our group would then be	1914.3998
A mere masque borrowed from	74.0733
Ha ha ye Romans <PAD>	17.3103
you thought to make us	2848.2502
But you dont know us	1576.9319
Upon my return home I	352.1049
He assured me that nothing	157.5003
One thing I was sorry	880.3237
Permesso inquired he <PAD> <PAD>	6.4403
Certainlycertainly cried Franz <PAD> <PAD>	6.9062
Come in my host Now	1541.8162
Take care my worthy host	1312.6820
But what have you done	17.6126

The first act of Franz	450.3596

At the end of the	47.6515
Well said the count what	600.2401
Before or after whichever you	2138.2239
You will describe it to	742.6251

When you come to Paris	560.6404
Come we have not any	1538.6552
While the three gentlemen walked	2717.7441
Which are your windows asked	208.9784
The three last returned he	1113.5160
Franz glanced rapidly towards the	26.7160
The side windows were hung	1021.5912
The man in the mantle	529.1382
The three windows were still	22.9432
Preparations were making on every	1038.0204
The masks could not appear	1514.2113
Franz Albert and the count	36.2086
As they approached the Piazza	2061.3108
At the corner of the	204.5179
The window let at an	935.0099
It consisted as we have	662.7112
On chairs were laid elegant	259.0757
As you left the choice	292.2263
It was the first time	1614.9237
Two men seated on the	1889.6034
Their repast consisted apparently of	53.7003
One of them lifted the	986.5784
These two men were the	26.1029
At this sight Franz felt	121.3964
The prisoners transported the previous	3625.4202
A double line of carbineers	850.1075
All the rest of the	45.1894
Many women held their infants	384.5323
The Monte Pincio seemed a	1427.4518
What the count said was	171.5321
And yet instead of the	881.4977
It was evident that the	228.0371
Suddenly the tumult ceased as	169.3729
A brotherhood of penitents clothed	2432.9985
Behind the penitents came a	87.8883
He was naked with the	875.3734
This man was the executioner	9.3408
He had moreover sandals bound	91.6925
Behind the executioner came in	244.1779
Each was accompanied by two	17.8278
Neither had his eyes bandaged	12.7408
Peppino walked with a firm	109.3964
Andrea was supported by two	18.7184
Each of them from time	216.9124
At this sight alone Franz	89.1609
He looked at Alberthe was	1487.4346
The count alone seemed unmovednay	753.5569
His nostrils dilated like those	3361.5942
And yet his features wore	1584.3787
However the two culprits advanced	161.7020
Peppino was a handsome young	1112.8196
Andrea was short and fat	1609.2123
In prison he had suffered	1264.5364
I thought said Franz to	435.4321
And yet here are two	724.9509
At the moment when Peppino	1145.9575
The piercing eye of Peppino	35.9183
The chief took the paper	1157.7244
Pardon for whom cried he	9.7339
Peppino remained breathless <PAD> <PAD>	8.6229
A pardon for Peppino called	173.2137
And he passed the paper	240.8291
For Peppino cried Andrea who	313.6814
Why for him and not	11.7753
We ought to die together	13.3643
I was promised he should	22.1454
You have no right to	35.5588
I will not die aloneI	1696.5576
The executioner made a sign	249.2921
What is going on asked	400.0231
Do you not see returned	703.7198
and were he able he	1025.0865
Oh man manrace of crocodiles	1436.6060
Here is a man who	635.8318
Do you know what gave	18.7449
do you know what consoled	14.8846
It was that another partook	738.2618
Lead two sheep to the	880.8343
But manman whom God created	3058.9075
A blasphemy <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.8525
Honor to man this masterpiece	816.8763
However the struggle still continued	51.0088
The two assistants carried Andrea	1540.0483
put him to death Franz	402.1006
What are you doing said	11.4155
Do you pity him <PAD>	8.1626
If you heard the cry	2002.8805
And yet you pity a	1183.6993
No nolook look The recommendation	39.5245
Franz was fascinated by the	25.8690
The two assistants had borne	1095.1229
During this time the executioner	593.5092
A dull and heavy sound	919.2296
The executioner let fall his	1866.8685
At every stroke a jet	88.5619
This time Franz could contain	369.4611
Albert with his eyes closed	61.9675
The count was erect and	75.8685
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Carnival at Rome When	1530.0979
He glanced mechanically towards the	4058.4893
The bell of Monte Citorio	1320.1418
Well asked he of the	452.2473
Make haste and dress yourself	1562.0183
He profited by this distraction	1918.2888
Decidedly man is an ungrateful	36.7569
But dress yourself see M	1776.4813
Well Albert said Franz do	127.5782
Come answer frankly Ma foi	52.8223
But I am really glad	579.6961
It must be allowed that	130.8952
Come dress yourselves gentlemen dress	1318.5250
He assumed his costume and	543.6567
Their toilet finished they descended	542.8969
They fell into the line	21.5613
It is difficult to form	173.3564
Instead of the spectacle of	2498.0889
A crowd of masks flowed	610.1829
From every street and every	18231.9395
Franz and Albert were like	836.5946
They saw or rather continued	1005.9764
A handful of confetti that	1100.0494
He rose in his turn	1135.1912
The strife had fairly begun	1656.2836
As for the Count of	571.3939
Imagine the large and splendid	1692.9138
At these balconies are three	3254.2251
Lovely women yielding to the	2527.9116
In the streets the lively	5606.8237
This will give a faint	60.3140
At the second turn the	919.1371
Franz looked upthey were opposite	49.8978
At the centre window the	1921.2869
Gentlemen said the count springing	885.7757
In the meantime dispose of	1009.7216
Franz thanked the count for	18.5077
As for Albert he was	1665.0892
Unfortunately for him the line	1233.9906
Ah my dear fellow said	1591.8999
At one of these encounters	237.1799
He instantly rose and cast	110.9194
Doubtless one of the charming	1651.5399
Albert seized it and as	724.6450
Albert placed it in his	74.3613
Well said Franz to him	561.1566
So I will not abandon	2883.7161
Bravo bravo said Franz things	33.9399
Shall I leave you <PAD>	7.2274
Perhaps you would prefer being	936.9830
If the fair peasant wishes	1773.1233
Then they returned to the	1004.7914
At this moment the same	363.6102
The file on the Corso	304.7910
Franz and Albert were opposite	1766.2451
Signor Pastrini came to the	40.1702
Franz hastened to inquire after	752.5637
The count had moreover charged	447.9803
Franz questioned Albert as to	1167.1122
A tailor said the host	1657.0768
The host shook his head	14.0648
To make you two costumes	39.4832
I ask your excellencies pardon	862.1605
Leave all to me and	552.8743
Albert as he took off	1487.0984
The two friends sat down	1244.8081
Truth compelled Franz in spite	516.4073
During dessert the servant inquired	96.7605
Albert and Franz looked at	203.6469
The servant understood them <PAD>	10.2628
His excellency the Count of	546.9102
This precaution taken they went	230.9706
During the first act the	31.8526
Her first look was at	600.3950
Her operaglass was so fixedly	1491.5483
Scarcely had they entered when	159.8762
Albert in his turn sat	16.1172
Well said she hardly giving	787.9390
Did anyone introduce you to	1108.6323
What sort of a man	1012.9294
We should be very hard	372.8855
A friend of ten years	1223.4929
At the Rospoli Palace The	222.4427
Did you pass through the	1579.4650
Those were the counts windows	62.9958
Do you know what those	2896.6084
This morning he made two	2190.1174
This circumstance had moreover the	870.5913
Signor Pastrini had already set	1481.4435
The next morning at nine	2246.8665
Albert was impatient to see	2554.9746
This picturesque attire set him	1450.4294
The Turks used to be	1503.2051
Franz complimented Albert who looked	311.8073
They were thus engaged when	55.9240
Gentlemen said he although a	302.8726
I come to say that	609.9685
The host will tell you	564.1801
Make use of it I	881.0645
The Count of Monte Cristo	990.1979
He was as we have	242.0497
A glance at the walls	530.2544
A few words he let	850.4866
The two friends did not	541.5660
They told him so frankly	798.8599
Albert was charmed with the	1069.1747
The permission to do what	852.0010
At halfpast one they descended	1473.1460
Albert had fastened the faded	95.3839
At the first sound of	268.0535
At the second turn a	1686.5526
Albert placed the fresh bouquet	745.0654
The day was as gay	1191.2716
It is almost needless to	475.6714
In the evening on his	627.0960
At each previous visit he	1173.1113
He did not then think	918.9947
On his return from the	1658.1233
At ten minutes past five	51.5761
The harlequin had reassumed her	379.0933
She was charming <PAD> <PAD>	6.7806
Franz congratulated Albert who received	526.4105
He had recognized by certain	374.6392
He had made up his	69.7838
Franz remarked while he gave	544.8606
He insisted upon it declaring	482.8056
Albert let himself be pressed	909.2795
Albert attributed to Franzs absence	503.3179
Franz was not sufficiently egotistical	1043.5352
He felt assured that the	1012.6580
He therefore promised Albert that	1029.4358
The next morning he saw	2094.6025
This belief was changed into	1943.3654
The evening was no longer	35.0699
Albert nothing doubted but that	146.4116
Franz anticipated his wishes by	827.2305
Albert was not deceived for	1327.8325
Well said he was I	63.7412
Read This word was pronounced	76.8951
Franz took the letter and	2278.7002
When you arrive at the	1401.1672
Until then you will not	13.5806
Constancy and Discretion Well asked	567.7670
Take care Albert said Franz	12.1269
All the nobility of Rome	1363.0461
You have read the letter	2001.9237
Yes Well read the letter	15.6373
Look at the writing and	1114.4265
You are born to good	78.6379
Laugh as much as you	228.0341
I see that I shall	935.8948
I adore Rome and I	1507.7994
Alberts love had not taken	29.2372
He hastened with Franz to	219.2871
After dinner the Count of	30.6723
They had not seen him	20.7894
Signor Pastrini informed them that	146.2828
He had started the previous	95.0334
He was charming <PAD> <PAD>	6.7752
Whether he kept a watch	1263.7238
The man was an enigma	19.5782
The count must feel sure	1226.8691
On his side however great	1144.3167
The count had learned that	890.4123
In consequence he brought them	656.8091
Franz and Albert made some	698.5515
This assurance determined the two	37.9508
Franz had by degrees become	1045.8191
He could not refrain from	1859.3350
Truly a Byronic hero <PAD>	12.8324
Franz could not we will	1135.1836
His forehead was marked with	1246.3927
The count was no longer	13.9712
He was at least forty	583.8080
And to complete his resemblance	778.7299
Albert was constantly expatiating on	135.0871
Franz was less enthusiastic but	1784.3029
He thought several times of	532.8755
And yet he did not	91.6150
The evening passed as evenings	1596.2166
The Countess G wished to	1386.1036
As similar intrigues are not	3391.4670
They promised upon separating to	653.6407
The heroine of the bouquet	1207.0624
At length Tuesday came the	134.4254
On Tuesday the theatres open	807.8875
On Tuesday all those who	1306.9902
From two oclock till five	1538.5356
The ftes are veritable pleasure	58.5613
The author of this history	1727.8700
Albert was triumphant in his	26.8658
A knot of rosecolored ribbons	164.5609
In order that there might	177.4310
As the day advanced the	31.7048
There was not on the	657.1628
It was a human storm	2003.8749
At three oclock the sound	2116.3330
The races like the moccoli	364.8228
At the sound of the	508.2300
All these evolutions are executed	1411.6450
The pedestrians ranged themselves against	951.5110
A detachment of carbineers fifteen	1010.1550
When the detachment arrived at	2459.2893
Almost instantly in the midst	1559.0975
Then the Castle of Saint	648.0266
Immediately without any other signal	2591.0017
A new source of noise	78.9413
The sellers of moccoletti entered	35.7397
The moccoli or moccoletti are	2356.6030
The moccoletto is like life	774.5888
But he has discovered a	408.9203
The moccoletto is kindled by	55.3018
But who can describe the	2593.2007
Everyone hastened to purchase moccolettiFranz	65.5260
The night was rapidly approaching	1636.5004
It was a signal <PAD>	8.0579
At the end of ten	3939.6069
It seemed like the fte	26.2345
It is impossible to form	93.6715
Suppose that all the stars	627.8572
The facchino follows the prince	431.2252
Had old olus appeared at	1350.6531
This battle of folly and	949.5879
Every five minutes Albert took	172.6914
The two friends were in	52.4536
Albert sprang out bearing his	43.7279
Two or three masks strove	2650.1082
The steps were crowded with	300.6073
Franz followed Albert with his	88.5838
Instantly a mask wearing the	2518.7805
Franz was too far off	1218.0526
He watched them pass through	800.8913
Suddenly the bell that gives	464.9299
It seemed as though one	180.2007
Franz found himself in utter	18.7335
No sound was audible save	1465.9733
The Carnival was over <PAD>	9.5425
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Catacombs of Saint Sebastian	3169.9407
It seemed as though Rome	1433.8834
By a chance which added	666.2453
The distance was short and	746.1611
Dinner was waiting but as	660.6714
Signor Pastrini who had been	1202.6896
The sudden extinction of the	1046.0795
He therefore dined very silently	1610.9167
Franz resolved to wait for	50.4740
He ordered the carriage therefore	1074.4833
At eleven oclock Albert had	29.7891
Franz dressed himself and went	533.1681
The house of the Duke	507.8693
Franz and Albert had brought	608.1455
Franz replied that he had	363.4736
Then he has not returned	17.4412
I waited for him until	37.4179
And do you know whither	1266.1992
I think on the contrary	563.3077
The night is gloomy and	2008.3929
I informed them at the	527.3253
Your excellency he said the	464.6294
Yes And who is the	454.0912

The man was wrapped up	35.9742
He went up to him	148.9135

Are not you the person	964.6631
Yesyour friend at least hopes	759.2542

Five corridors diverged like the	2028.5326
Down one of the corridors	465.5859
The count laid his hand	36.1024

You owe me nothing but	1106.7556
All that however has nothing	400.5876
My father the Comte de	2100.3704
I can scarcely credit it	1313.1560
Your offer however smooths all	1014.1875
Well never mind how it	207.5131
Perhaps by the time you	436.1353
A most edifying representative I	283.5858
But as regards your wish	985.8410
But tell me now count	996.8988

The young men then rose	80.5355

He dwelt with considerable force	1321.0555
He recounted with circumstantial exactitude	1110.4618
Then he detailed the conversation	576.8920
At last he arrived at	569.2615
Albert listened with the most	22.7654
Well said he when Franz	300.1427
The count is fond of	205.6634
Go but to Portsmouth or	1075.6223

At the end of a	463.5849
Shrubs and creeping plants covered	1386.1863
On the floor above were	1202.8989

It is the first time	38.8794
He is black and can	38.9156
It is Ali cried Albert	61.1892
Yes Ali himself my Nubian	1122.2692
But how could you charge	1389.4209
He knows my tastes my	43.5157
He has been here a	213.0920
He will arrange everything for	16.8284
He knew that I should	845.4182
He gave me this paper	970.6453
Ah that is really original	22.0523
And very princely added ChteauRenaud	18.0059
What do you not know	27.9714
No said Monte Cristo I	364.1422
We must content ourselves then	517.8671
I in my quality of	1444.9586
No he is a countryman	196.9718
But you know him M	1523.5004
I would not be quite	1027.3276
Of how much does he	613.1588
I am sure he answers	1346.2499
He thought of the fair	613.4746
I have something better than	77.9308
You procure your mistresses from	2349.9028
Everyone who surrounds me is	727.4711
My dear Albert said Debray	50.5594
Your guest is charming but	285.7306
I must return to the	13.6693
I will tell him of	539.9282
Au revoir Albert <PAD> <PAD>	8.7076
Gentlemen good morning As he	1519.3623

The Presentation When Albert found	1673.5139
You who are accustomed to	1682.9528
As we pass from one	655.7488
Albert led him first to	195.7759
Monte Cristo quickly appreciated all	9542.0225
Morcerf had expected he should	595.7502
They descended to the first	113.1876
The salon was filled with	3152.6594
Albert expected to have something	633.6810
From the salon they passed	398.7222
A single portrait signed by	634.4822
This portrait attracted the Count	1291.4518
It was the portrait of	1030.5138
She wore the picturesque costume	1893.9061
She was looking at the	337.4928
The light was so faint	918.4506
Silence prevailed for an instant	227.7626
You have there a most	1390.4065
You do not know my	64.8579
She had her portrait painted	119.5543
This costume is a fancy	556.8241
The countess had this portrait	76.3516
She doubtless intended giving him	1340.6260
It is true between ourselves	1155.8065
It is different with my	1684.5972
Excuse my talking of family	449.9196
The picture seems to have	1413.8027
This disagreement is the only	715.1069
Now said Albert that you	586.6513
Consider yourself as in your	637.9200
You are somewhat blas I	1560.5293
However accept what I propose	2518.5017
Albert summoned his servant and	529.7315
Albert followed him with the	11.3806
When they arrived at the	1525.8538
Monte Cristo stopped and examined	22.9483
Azure seven merlets or placed	43.4281
These are doubtless your family	17.9982
Except the knowledge of blazons	1124.4177
Besides you must have something	544.9846
Excuse my putting such a	560.6679
You have guessed rightly <PAD>	11.8501
These are our arms that	621.5128
By her side I am	488.6428
Almost all the armed pilgrims	1232.2196
One of your ancestors had	900.5350
At present I no longer	648.5063
As for you viscount continued	781.9963
Yes you are at once	945.0914
Morcerf thanked him with a	560.3945
In the most conspicuous part	67.2852
It was that of a	846.1171
Monte Cristo was engaged in	1123.0358
He was a man of	1010.7351
He was dressed in plain	1020.4899
He entered with a tolerably	87.3264

Made a peer at the	758.4274

Alas continued the stranger doubtless	1866.3994
France will not perhaps be	22.4634
She treats her children ill	1806.9211
If I did not fear	806.8368
Monte Cristo turned round hastily	659.6678
She had been there some	116.2060
The latter rose and bowed	138.8243
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468

She thanked them both with	22.7140
No returned she but I	849.3295

Now I thank you for	544.1671
Madame said he the count	125.1462

I have already made my	408.1504
The sitting commences at two	573.0834
Monsieur continued she turning to	379.5614
I will not detain you	1682.3246
Monte Cristo was not deceived	10.9319
As soon as he appeared	630.4519
It was a coup of	949.4018
Monsieur said the count to	277.1615
Give me therefore one more	735.8790
You have decidedly some genius	1971.8813
When Albert returned to his	953.2122
Albert could not see the	553.2130

The count never plays he	1729.8040
What then have I to	688.0432

It is necessary that we	84.3780

Most decidedly said he men	1043.1600
Monsieur Bertuccio Meanwhile the count	850.5843

A thick clump of trees	1909.1534
This house isolated from the	499.2510

Such things continued Bertuccio shaking	1482.9213
Turn Chartreux or Trappist and	1205.4237
I confess I am not	798.1483

Everyone must live Certainly go	947.9542
I possessed a thousand francs	13.3722
I left five hundred with	757.3566
It was easy to do	460.0007
But after we had taken	1082.9380
At last however we succeeded	68.4408
I left the boat between	1212.3571
Just at this time the	143.1666

Go on As I entered	2585.0522
At the sight of this	1781.9434
I hastened to the innkeeper	11.3261
My misgivings had been but	24.5299
My brother had arrived the	502.1569
I did all in my	1064.8723
I then thought of that	475.5394
Yes your excellency he came	121.3578
His zeal had procured him	544.6008
You are the representative of	890.2616
A lieutenant in the Corsican	1400.3397

All these old soldiers commit	1174.3470
Pray try and obtain a	3096.0542
It is a misfortune and	63.7420
If we are to judge	586.8156
What has happened is quite	1011.0089
You have mistaken the time	424.9293
Go now at once or	474.2765
But he was a man	13.5572
I approached him and said	537.1999
You think that it was	715.7329
Well I who am a	311.2560
From this moment I declare	760.2341
But did he know what	775.7324
Fortunately I was so well	50.5844
Then he became alarmed and	1352.5504
But as you know a	1227.2892
The most important thing was	1087.6333
I no longer belonged to	245.1829
For three months I watched	1161.4512
At length I discovered that	54.8791
I followed him thither and	641.4687
As I had nothing more	448.7776
If I wished to surprise	308.1619
The house belonged as the	323.7108

I concluded that he was	74.0027
Three hours later the man	1530.0139
I descended rapidly although I	535.1423
I crossed the street and	510.3693
This time I did not	609.8301
My first care was to	462.1152

Midnight struck <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5731
As the last stroke died	1219.1606
The door opened and the	37.1924
The terrible moment had come	594.7662
I drew my knife from	196.4212
The man in the mantle	512.1060
I was afraid not of	45.9307
When he was only a	434.7109

Then I confess curiosity mingled	697.6537
Then an idea crossed my	1369.5311
I let him place the	708.8361

In a second I had	576.8021
In a fine linen cloth	90.6214
Its purple visage and its	2167.5642
After a moment I fancied	544.7590
In my turn I uttered	64.5611
God has not cursed me	756.7429
It was an embarrassing load	694.5710
As I passed the city	496.7332
No objection was raised but	1420.4540
A fortnight after I was	1631.8342
An H and an N	4702.8638

For the assassination itself I	58.6980
Poor Assunta had guessed all	14.8434
She had profited by my	693.3090

Ah Assunta cried I you	1339.4484
Never did a perverse nature	1794.7678

You can not beat me	495.8678
The boy triumphed and this	1846.6099
When I was at Rogliano	1413.0540
When he was only eleven	1349.1597
I became alarmed as any	198.1533
I was compelled at this	1042.3564
I hoped that the active	1625.4181
I spoke to Benedetto alone	951.1395
He heard me patiently and	97.1306
Are you mad uncle he	647.4086
Why I have as much	551.7566
You see that I should	1029.5354

Our expedition made a favorable	22.7369
We anchored our vesselwhich had	3104.7561

I waited patiently not to	1140.2643
The man who was with	579.9361
Caderousse entered hastily <PAD> <PAD>	8.0972
Then seeing that the room	878.2487
What do you say asked	40.8668
I say that the diamond	549.4370
Only in order to satisfy	516.6723
In the meantime please to	1805.9495
Relate your story madame said	668.3301
Oh returned she it was	31.2648
My husband was a great	124.3813
This poor fellow whom Caderousse	797.3673
Theres only the price we	200.6176
I thought we agreed for	1363.7809
The abb told us it	865.4700
The Abb Busoni said La	22.4489
He was a foreigner An	1252.8435
At the sight of the	1377.8348
I did not look on	830.2382
Had you known this Edmond	604.1277
I will give you said	570.4160
However I will not go	635.5829
Ah true replied the jeweller	46.7130
No matter observed Caderousse replacing	2079.5015
It is not natural that	104.9579
He will inform against you	12.1826
You will have to find	972.6970
The law would seize it	685.0085
No said Caderousse we are	742.2106
There was evidently a severe	808.2531
He turned towards his wife	12.5397
What do you think of	45.7697
Let him have itlet him	28.2222
If he returns to Beaucaire	975.1625
But my wife wants a	1928.4020
Here he said I am	2129.7822
I hope you will not	40.3161
The abb told me it	56.2923
Come comegive it to me	11.3379
What a strange fellow you	125.1985
I give you francsthat is	939.5032
Comelet us see them Here	759.3161
Wait whilst I light the	1427.4082
The thunder growled in the	1412.1460
I myself felt a strange	930.2404
Caderousse counted and again counted	1247.5260
During this time the jeweller	1291.0165
Well inquired the jeweller is	76.7210
Give me the pocketbook La	1304.3760
From the former she took	1050.4567
There said Caderousse and now	507.4576
I invite you with goodwill	1325.6600
Goodnight my friends <PAD> <PAD>	6.3882
If the Abb Busoni should	1616.9102
Write to me at Paris	279.8448
<PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8457
I will make the journey	594.6360
See here exclaimed Caderousse <PAD>	9.7290
You can not think of	598.6909
And then there are robbers	33.8629
The road is never very	1297.5249
Here said he are dogs	587.2693
It seemed as though they	267.4310
Well then a good journey	25.0052
Thanks replied the jeweller <PAD>	8.4025
He then took his cane	250.4390
At the moment when he	748.9990
Oh said he this is	828.0210
You can sleep here Yes	1295.9507
So once more goodnight Caderousse	83.1524
I can see neither heaven	209.9134
Do I turn to the	118.4295
You can not go wrongthe	2243.8108
Close the door said La	1195.8137
He came into the room	745.5498
I never saw such an	637.4760
The woman especially was hideous	4188.1265
Why she inquired in a	1101.5502
If you had been a	689.1418
Therelisten And at this moment	1209.2618
Mercy said Caderousse crossing himself	13.1802
At the same moment and	1020.1489
Caderousse and his wife started	68.4791
Whos there cried Caderousse rising	1093.1238
It is I shouted a	14.0406
And who are you Eh	1228.5756
Why the good God sends	400.3889
La Carconte on the contrary	790.3978
The shortest follies are best	44.8261
You offered me hospitality and	1616.2102
La Carconte doublelocked the door	49.1026
The Rain of Blood As	1694.5380
Caderousses hands still grasped the	2953.0107
Well well said the jeweller	873.5896
Have you any other guests	40.6193
Nobody but ourselves replied Caderousse	1183.3003
Not at all my dear	151.6847
Not at all I assure	1262.4036
The jeweller meanwhile was humming	2148.5076
Caderousse had once more parted	1674.4742
He then began pacing the	951.8682
There said La Carconte as	942.3311
I dont want any supper	25.2453
We dined so very late	79.6958
Then it seems I am	62.5183
Oh we shall have the	915.2364
From time to time Caderousse	1042.2969
The storm still continued <PAD>	11.1840
There there said La Carconte	31.4831
upon my word you did	605.6715
Well said the jeweller as	508.6587
Had the unhappy man on	2498.8682
Caderousse meanwhile continued to pace	1467.3215
I believe the storm is	21.2097
But as if to contradict	1033.0319
Trembling and awestruck Caderousse hastily	1390.5643
You must be tired said	932.1381
He passed over my head	191.6903
The quick eager glance of	1258.4688
All these circumstances did not	778.6813
Overhead I could accurately distinguish	1523.4263
Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy	2166.2891
I looked into the kitchen	708.5942
La Carconte continued to gaze	1419.6130
At this moment the expiring	1688.7842
La Carconte still kept her	1151.9814
Caderousse shuddered <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.9188
The womans lips seemed to	1910.7765
Confused sights and sounds seemed	957.5345
How long I had been	639.0123
Weak and tottering footsteps resounded	2092.4971
I had not yet fully	2940.1968
A cry more prolonged than	3237.5957
Hastily raising myself on one	480.8770
To the fearful noises that	1179.9512
The staircase creaked he descended	423.4186
The man was Caderoussehe was	96.3201
Having obtained the light he	643.6862
A moment later he came	1149.7319
After this he took from	682.6003
Then all became clear and	828.9873
I fancied that I still	1718.6184
For this purpose I applied	956.1197
The poorly fastened boards which	1335.1224
Hastily snatching up the lighted	2241.6633
It was that of La	13.1578
The pistol I had heard	61.3269
The shot had frightfully lacerated	2190.5989
She was stone dead <PAD>	9.6452
I strode past her and	879.9481
The furniture had been knocked	734.2767
The murdered man lay on	899.6821
I stumbled over some object	1507.7010
I approached the jeweller who	411.3241
This appalling sight almost bereft	1280.0842
I rushed towards the staircase	241.9894
Upon reaching the room below	1614.6735
They threw themselves upon me	13.4767
I made no resistance I	79.5429
When I strove to speak	189.2758
As I noticed the significant	2000.6135
I pointed to the spot	42.2945
What does he mean asked	21.7500
One of the officers went	30.9776
He means replied the man	418.4984
Then I saw that they	31.1581
I recovered force and energy	1036.4006
Indeed indeed I did not	816.8160
Stir but a step said	508.1190
Meanwhile come along with us	976.2591
I was utterly overpowered by	1147.3097
I had been tracked by	1272.4728
One only chance was left	876.0629
If Caderousse had invented the	1229.3662
Two months passed away in	946.6741
Caderousse still evaded all pursuit	470.1998
My trial was to come	888.3936
You may easily imagine with	1112.5225
I felt some degree of	981.1289
And then it was that	1056.0535
That which I had done	743.9230
My voluntary confession of the	793.8948
When he quitted me he	702.5664
I had speedy proofs that	1649.6990
In the interim it pleased	1281.2727
The wretched man was sentenced	784.2117
Your mode of life as	403.7579
Would you like such a	13.9727
If so I will give	499.8665
It is unnecessary for you	1050.3765
Here take this continued he	914.8136
How comes it that having	962.0283
Anxious as you may suppose	772.3895
Acting by my advice my	2136.0972
One morning he threatened her	1156.1891
Evening came and still with	266.5465
As the eleventh hour struck	1575.3229
She stretched out her arms	589.1095
Two held poor Assunta who	1171.0988
The third proceeded to barricade	1274.6165
In the struggle her clothes	1363.6748
Covered with flames Assunta rushed	1179.0750
The cries died away in	3876.8687
Benedetto never again appeared at	893.0337
It was subsequently to these	810.9071
As a punishment for the	60.4626
Oh those Villeforts are an	614.6848
And now resumed Bertuccio your	1069.4822
At this instant a shudder	1095.4374
The Abb Busoni did right	623.2674
As for that Benedetto who	1648.0408
Thank God I have never	725.3475
And now your excellency he	1167.5247
Villefort merited punishment for what	108.2910
Benedetto if still living will	1878.9768
As far as you yourself	340.3122
Ask yourself wherefore after rescuing	1162.7306
There was the crime Bertucciothat	1226.8580
My first duty directly I	1034.1028
Perhaps too the natural and	426.6128
And then again I am	788.9816
After a brief silence rendered	705.1824
For all evils there are	51.4094
And now leave me Monsieur	101.0735
The very circumstances which inflict	2047.2853
The chief beauty of trees	4296.0029
Here I have a garden	852.6395
This to me who expected	876.0783
I have no fear of	612.8563
Retire within Bertuccio and tranquillize	28.0670
Should your confessor be less	1204.1339
Monte Cristo left alone took	1825.4983
There is the little door	28.4558
At this corner is the	106.4342
There will be no necessity	746.6370
The carriage proceeded rapidly towards	23.1447
That same evening upon reaching	971.4399
Nor although preceding the party	2461.9011
Ali was his principal attendant	73.1710
Having given various orders to	1021.3092
Have the French attendants been	1656.4716
Ali having pointed to the	1006.0469
I understand said Monte Cristo	2491.0828
Madame will be tired tonight	189.4623
Desire the French attendants not	916.0433
You will also see that	537.5417
Just at that moment voices	62.4631
The gate opened a carriage	148.5470
The count hastily descended presented	870.6889
She raised the hand extended	607.1696
Some few words passed between	893.6313
The young woman spoke with	1096.3639
Preceded by Ali who carried	975.6532
In another hour every light	1078.7823
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
Unlimited Credit About two oclock	1968.6250
While waiting the occupant of	584.6256
His glance was keen but	2008.3307
The groom in obedience to	1542.9967
Ali returned a sign in	18.3962
But what asked the groom	11.1123
His excellency does not receive	508.9882
You will take it to	583.8857
Well asked Danglars <PAD> <PAD>	6.7378
The man somewhat crestfallen by	285.3716
Bless me murmured Baron Danglars	1085.7300
However it does not signify	617.3729
That fellow has a decidedly	920.5499
How comes it that all	3281.4595
Ali cried he striking at	83.7287
Ali appeared <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.3863
Summon Bertuccio said the count	9.4973
Almost immediately Bertuccio entered the	18.0653
Did your excellency desire to	30.4746
I did replied the count	9.3422
You no doubt observed the	349.4606
I noticed them for their	1437.8745
It is not your fault	731.1358
You do not understand the	561.7488
Permit me to assure your	407.8858
It seems sir steward said	538.6127
Then offer him double that	2702.8008
Monte Cristo regarded the person	1320.3622
I have to pay a	34.4329
I desire that these horses	919.2142
I beg your excellencys pardon	1739.1862
Then turning towards Ali he	758.0398
Request her also to oblige	955.4329
Now leave me and desire	1361.7534
Monsieur Baptistin said the count	585.9376
You suit me very well	42.8275
It only remains for me	604.9066
Listen if you please till	84.0131
You receive francs per annum	4302.5347
You live in a manner	1951.1361
Then though yourself a servant	660.6667
Again you make a profit	1002.9269
It would be long indeed	852.0737
I neither illuse nor illtreat	155.1473
An error I readily forgive	190.8487
My commands are ordinarily short	1820.2986
I am rich enough to	583.8520
If then I should learn	769.4978
You may now retire <PAD>	10.3939
I never caution my servants	524.5353
I forgot to mention to	943.5433
You have been in my	1266.1389
I assure your excellency said	853.2727
He can not possibly serve	844.6510
You seem incredulous said Monte	989.6882
The Nubian smiled assentingly to	1360.9835
This corroboration of the lesson	1275.9252
The count then motioned the	1069.1772
As the hand of the	230.6362
When Ali was wanted one	218.8027
The steward entered <PAD> <PAD>	7.8953
My horses said Monte Cristo	11.1500
They are at the door	80.3333
Does your excellency wish me	728.1566
As he passed them he	891.9591
Nay if your excellency is	74.1700
Whither does your excellency desire	3234.1365
As Bertuccio with a respectful	178.1017
I have another commission for	832.0458
You see I give you	30.0717
It will be absolutely necessary	1526.7083
She draws only fifteen feet	19.3825
She must be kept in	479.6198
Make the requisite inquiries for	1024.1914
The corvette must now I	1080.8157
I wish you to write	432.7736
Danglars was engaged at that	101.9929
But the meeting was nearly	126.7160
As the counts title sounded	970.3829
I confess this is the	1220.7301
I took the trouble this	977.8530
But would you believe it	1468.4050
I made inquiries and found	761.3192
But pursued Danglars with one	1897.9183
I am very anxious to	22.9373
I suspect a hoax is	649.4233
They laugh best who laugh	2577.2441
It was to this apartment	525.6026
He found the count standing	1043.0057
The count turned round as	96.4154
With a slight inclination of	1179.3634
The count sat down <PAD>	10.1138
I have the honor I	162.4635
And I of speaking to	1102.8688
Danglars felt the irony and	33.7449
You will I trust excuse	706.0157
That was a noble example	873.4800
I understand perfectly Again Danglars	1371.2386
Permit me to inform you	641.0275
I have acquired the bad	1991.6938
But as regards the letter	690.6683
You have received a regular	1764.9216
Here I am ready to	669.5081
Well this letter gives the	1262.6372
The people who wrote are	674.2200
Is it possible that Thomson	290.0211
Pray tell me what you	1089.5388
Precisely what I was about	23.7598
Now what is vague is	916.9575
It was the second time	161.3200
His forced politeness sat awkwardly	162.3006
Monte Cristo on the contrary	2443.4355
Well sir resumed Danglars after	1330.2002
So throwing himself back in	1194.8470
I said a million replied	52.0983
But could I do with	40.4746
My dear sir if a	1047.9711
A million <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.0288
Excuse my smiling when you	830.3534
A man like Danglars was	250.5031
The effect of the present	403.9320
The pupils of his eyes	157.0272
Come come said Monte Cristo	341.4616
I understand and foreseeing that	1087.9922
See here are two similar	1241.6833
Now sir you have but	467.8345
Oh sir said Danglars after	621.7346
I can be no longer	1226.8767
Then you can let me	511.2021
You are quite sure that	1578.4268
However we shall see <PAD>	8.3485
Be kind enough then to	41.8612
I shall be at home	1024.3448
How would you like to	12.6802
in gold silver or notes	1388.7036
I must confess to you	634.3649
May I presume to ask	738.7277
The period appointed by the	1355.4313
Your ignorance on the subject	64.8697
However you will be better	1116.2139
With your tastes and means	1806.3353
If I mistake not you	872.4988
If you will permit me	971.1176
Not a modern picture among	22.1432
I can not endure the	1519.5804
For the present I will	1242.7601
Is the baroness at home	20.8553
Yes my lord answered the	12.4249
And alone No my lord	1540.8300
Debray inquired Danglars with an	801.3688
Yes my lord replied the	16.9537
Debray is with madame Danglars	149.2290
Lucien Debray is an old	347.8575
As for my wife I	648.5172
Her maiden name was De	1324.4381
you are acquainted with the	1282.0726
Let me see have I	1166.2394
I forget how but I	863.3115
With your permission said Danglars	987.2141
The Dappled Grays The baron	2608.5056
The chairs were of ancient	3323.6284
The truth was it had	1004.3109
The decorations of the boudoir	281.7369
M Danglars however while possessing	1112.4896
Madame Danglars who although past	1383.6075
Lucien had found time preparatory	644.0629
It will be remembered that	901.4595
Already excited by the wonderful	1100.0536
This posing at the piano	864.3008
A most gracious welcome and	1920.1879
Baroness said Danglars give me	727.0217
I need but mention one	625.9235
That means balls dinners and	1409.6870
And when did you arrive	28.6274
Yesterday morning madame Coming as	271.7188
Pardon meat least such I	125.9889
This time I have merely	899.0804
Paris is a horrible place	22.1900
Balls parties and ftes are	1224.4781
As for the Thatre Franais	119.9696
The only amusements left us	240.3564
Do you propose entering any	1275.5973
Madame Danglars turned very pale	692.7512
What my maid tells me	1216.1925
I desire to know what	520.0070
Oh yes I will listen	411.7229
These two gentlemen shall decide	235.7243
Gentlemen continued the baroness among	1273.2953
But to you at least	797.3232
Well I had promised Madame	676.6381
No doubt M Danglars has	1020.6471
Oh what a detestable crew	1879.2708
But perhaps you have disposed	773.2289
You are setting up an	133.1552
I should have liked to	76.3810
I have almost given them	526.2549
They were only fit for	887.5430
There they are <PAD> <PAD>	6.0773
Come M Debray you are	1027.4512
I could not tell you	507.9507
Some madman or fool bent	2132.3164
Come dont look so angry	441.7588
There what do you think	23.4149
Wasnt I right to part	662.5798
Great heavens suddenly exclaimed Debray	17.0309
What is it asked the	11.7130
I can not be mistaken	31.2203
The very animals we were	2017.2690
Tis indeed they said she	10.5235
Danglars looked absolutely stupefied <PAD>	12.9368
How very singular cried Monte	55.4745
I can not believe it	24.0218
Madame Danglars whispered a few	1067.1663
Poor Danglars looked so crestfallen	466.0028
See said the count how	34.9453
Your kind attention in providing	790.0591
But so it is a	959.5566
Therefore in my opinion my	853.5450
Debray who perceived the gathering	1949.7596
Excellent murmured Monte Cristo to	38.4942
All has gone according to	21.9272
The domestic peace of this	81.2025
Now then to play another	546.4686
Still added he amid all	969.9661
But he went on with	708.5421
Two hours afterwards Madame Danglars	1418.5385
The horses were sent back	840.8042
To Danglars Monte Cristo also	1649.8940
During the evening Monte Cristo	108.5001
The following day about three	1035.8755
Ali observed his master as	1534.0947
I thought I did not	14.7376
With your lasso you could	440.4333

It is well said Monte	12.7937
Then listen to me <PAD>	8.1144
Ere long a carriage will	1729.5276
The count patted him gently	2125.6001
Still as five oclock approached	1080.6064
He stationed himself in a	1766.2510
Suddenly a distant sound of	1453.8140
In the vehicle was a	737.3739
Terror seemed to have deprived	114.3721
The carriage creaked and rattled	1955.1791
Ali suddenly cast aside his	2354.1030
Gladly availing himself of this	1238.0809
All this was achieved in	140.1995
The brief space had however	1005.6633

The child was small for	54.9985
A mass of straight black	4000.0977
His mouth was large and	1292.6069
His first movement was to	974.5670
Touch nothing my little friend	1054.0055

At sight of him Madame	1102.6753

Scarcely had the first congratulations	1313.1158
I remember how unmercifully I	1602.6375
Your horses got as far	2304.9934
The count then hastened to	1079.3417

He spoke in a voice	1214.1541
Monsieur replied the count with	612.3196
He glanced around in order	1015.1334
He saw the map which	1039.0549
It is a rich study	867.8492
I have believed it was	747.8068
It is an algebraic axiom	1636.4316
Thus the count was halfway	1420.5665
Ah you philosophize replied Villefort	2112.8545
Now really let me ask	165.5143
or to speak in plain	1782.2280
It was a long time	767.5054
The procureur exerted himself to	20.6136

It is not usual with	1566.2695

Well Ali my Nubian believes	2244.8691
You may therefore comprehend that	1992.6390
I have only two adversariesI	2010.3187

Why should I leave you	655.1694
My father said I was	902.4023
He is here and here	77.1925

You cried she with tones	1229.2003
You now understand Hayde said	1268.7643
Within this mansion you are	1608.0449
A carriage waits your orders	542.9217
There is but one favor	526.3964
Make no allusion to the	1480.4386

He was my friend he	435.0344
Recollect what our excellent father	1203.5168

In matters of speculation however	6169.0059
And so as we have	594.5742

Oh Maximilian how can you	1242.8319
But listen to me Valentine	58.2440
I became weary of ranging	2742.5964
That would compromise the honor	567.5797
Pray do not call what	293.5484
Consider by becoming a gardener	2076.2012
Think of that Valentine <PAD>	7.0544
There is nothing now to	1840.4686
Only imagine what happiness that	35.3516
I can scarcely contain myself	49.1975
Such felicity seems above all	144.7200
But would you believe that	1165.7863
Henceforth we have nothing to	13.0461
I am on my own	712.2456

When you spoke to me	2191.6636
You told me my dear	804.0972
I kept in the background	613.8638
But what cared I for	1385.5447
If you will only repeat	850.0122
Is it possible to find	80.6125
You have permitted me to	682.8451
And since I found means	1321.5375
Never has a complaint or	43.4191
I have been bound by	385.5647
Come come dearest Valentine confess	1396.7485
You promised to bestow on	88.0933

Oh how bitter a fate	1315.2496
Indeed indeed Maximilian I am	611.0182
When I think of you	1246.5870
M Franz is not expected	695.9821
Let us then hope for	118.3178
Meanwhile Valentine while reproaching me	1483.9363
What promise of future reward	770.1097
What granted mescarcely more <PAD>	14.3860
You tell me of M	914.3670

Oh Valentine were I in	851.5713
A rapid change took place	65.9244
Dearest dearest Valentine exclaimed he	790.6843
Outwardly and in the eyes	467.6140
The general remark is Oh	872.2975
What though she has lost	866.3351

Madame de Villefort has nothing	319.6111
Alas how gladly would I	1293.0803
God knows I would prefer	1641.7887
Then too my father is	1060.8290
Dear Maximilian believe me when	742.8054
The days when such distinctions	2104.6804
The aristocracy of the lance	195.1943
Now I belong to this	2518.6436
My fortune though small is	1322.1615
Oh if my mother were	597.0553

But what did M Danglars	520.5638
And I suspected that the	495.8742

What is the matter dear	373.8363
With what my father said	116.6713
Perhaps you liked what M	98.7947
Oh then you were glad	840.6010
Perhaps it was a mere	1023.1840
Mademoiselle mademoiselle exclaimed a voice	39.1405
Madame is searching for you	1248.5419
The name of Monte Cristo	900.8266

Madame de Villefort who was	719.7704
But I cant be severe	1263.0503
My husband dines with the	1512.9958
What is your sister Valentine	1189.2175
Madame de Villefort merely cried	3205.7107
But what detains her <PAD>	11.0083
Go Edward and see Because	620.7120
And where is she then	10.1819
If you know why dont	1616.4214
Madame de Villefort stretched out	1407.0725
She appeared much dejected and	1716.5496
Valentine whom we have in	1590.5092

Mademoiselle de Villefort my stepdaughter	1402.9724

The conditions are favorable what	212.2082
Your orchestra is too noisy	16.8488
To sleep after the manner	1308.7346
So my dear viscount whenever	1299.0670

You have a charming young	72.6740

Yes indeed count said Madame	649.0109

Haydes nervous system is delicately	3012.1699

Upon his return to Hayde	55.7331
As soon as she saw	595.5503

Are you not rich yourself	1565.8312
Your name is celebrated your	722.9949
As for me I consider	728.9208
There is still something else	18.3350
I confess observed Monte Cristo	1167.2013
for you told me your	1088.2723
I can not account for	701.5076
There was to have been	792.1738
Oh real enough from anxiety	481.1224
There is no hurry you	13.8803

Monte Cristo although apparently indifferent	1167.9150
This embarrassment had completely escaped	1678.3800
The count in taking leave	679.7724
Do you not think on	564.1674
M Danglars is my banker	948.8375

The Count of Monte Cristo	24.4523
Yes sir and I think	721.0070
You are charged with a	163.1056

Well monsieur I am at	648.2374

Ah yes that is the	16.8512
Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti <PAD> <PAD>	8.9290
And you really mean to	641.2714
The history which he related	870.8944
At length he one day	1039.0742
Your father did not hesitate	1015.2021
You were in the south	685.0373
Then your father ought to	505.1437
True interrupted the young man	562.5824
Finally he is anxious to	701.9784
I believe he found you	648.7569
Your misfortunes engaged his sympathies	139.7130
He told me that he	314.3317
He did seek and has	883.7211
I am quite aware that	1036.1586
Now sir pray do not	501.4854

Those who took me from	1052.4099

Your history is quite a	2956.0906
This is the kind of	140.9102
You would hardly have recited	1773.6831
You would be no longer	980.8243
You might excite a little	988.7797
You must resolve upon one	1005.0659
I would offer myself as	1789.5447
Ah said the count watching	988.9862
You shall soon see him	11.2479
He is a little stiff	903.8854
We are not generally very	43.0532
In short you will find	1014.6998
But said he so long	546.1273
Yes you will receive it	517.7471
He has at the request	551.2260
Only a few days replied	19.8825
His service does not allow	1590.2643
Therefore said Monte Cristo feigning	1296.1595
Are you prepared to embrace	821.5620
Monte Cristo watched him till	1068.8760

In France my dear sir	1007.9138
My dear M Cavalcanti said	931.7129
Make yourself easy we are	1289.9003

As for me my heart	294.6449
There is only one thing	721.2288

You should furnish him with	60.0434

Well then he deputes me	838.2865

At length the longdesired sound	756.6541
The delay had been occasioned	1024.1909
That she might not appear	839.0236
The young man with the	1154.3860
Besides although she avoided coming	2333.7581
You see it is not	1712.7501
It is unnecessary to state	424.9909
In about half an hour	984.7961
In a few minutes Valentine	42.3866
For fear that anyone should	1582.8103
Goodevening Valentine said a wellknown	16.4118
Goodevening Maximilian I know I	631.6712
I was not aware that	849.1088
From the manner in which	1126.6213
You possess a quality which	83.1876
It is that indefinable charm	903.8820
I was observing you both	595.9832
It only proves how little	365.1003
You can not at least	914.4124
But return to your question	1497.4989
Ah I see you are	959.4006
Nothing replied Maximilian <PAD> <PAD>	7.0839
Then why did you smile	876.3712
But do not let us	578.8130
Yes you are right I	40.9295
What a life I cause	216.0028
I bitterly reproach myself I	1504.9543
And I have also a	1566.2314
You must hope for us	1177.3805
I can only tell you	644.0899
Let them take my fortune	697.2310
You would love me as	469.2844
What should I care for	949.4091
But do you not fear	543.7591
I assure you that as	951.9830
I am a brute <PAD>	9.8251
But I was going to	437.6364
Ah heavens if it were	13.7500
But no the communication would	1505.6614
Then I feel as if	616.6691
If she objects to your	1182.7018
If she dislikes that so	649.2935
About a year ago I	74.0003
Madame de Villefort in spite	886.2607
You can form no idea	702.6431
When he learned my resolution	704.9033
Ah Maximilian I experienced at	1222.7837
Ah Maximilian I may have	706.0349
But tell me what interest	1083.5221
I possess nearly livres in	1435.0032
My brother Edward who inherits	441.3708
Now if I had taken	543.5621
No human being not even	107.7922
Valentine will you permit me	464.1274
A friend Maximilian and who	20.6775
I tremble to give my	38.6091
Have you never experienced for	930.5718
Nay further have you never	1143.4424
Ah Maximilian I had hoped	1624.4736
I feel as if it	749.5457
Indeed said Maximilian I have	1055.0474
It can not be surely	728.6192
Courted by my stepmother who	1565.7200
de Monte Cristo appears to	1944.6705
He meets Albert de Morcerf	1183.4431
This man evidently possesses the	381.9399
I never saw more simple	104.0760
His smile is so sweet	580.9962
Ah Valentine tell me if	204.0912
if so depend on it	811.1268
Ah he is not generous	1115.7239
You say he loves you	77.7639
All would pay deference to	1329.8773
Who knows but that in	677.1591
It is not just that	89.7412
Ah forgive me said Valentine	1096.7236
I do not deny the	434.8755
I will not make a	350.8711
I can only say how	166.3660
But indeed I am not	75.9904
Tell me what this Count	643.1839
Still as I have already	472.4261
Has the sun done anything	19.3432
No he warms me with	317.1578
Has such and such a	46.6769
No its odor charms one	1177.5529
My friendship for him is	82.2120
A secret voice seems to	1172.0836
In his most simple actions	759.6938
You will perhaps smile at	583.8684
However I have managed to	834.7310
He invited me to dine	402.8972
Well what have I learned	14.3988
That your mother and M	91.2364
I shall meet them there	371.1541
This may appear to you	1859.1771
I believe that this singular	1378.4526
Is it possible that you	249.4168
Pray reflect a little <PAD>	9.4810
My father who never goes	1326.7946
No no it is as	438.7455
It is nevertheless conclusive to	25.0609
My ten years of service	1461.2512
When you are away I	545.1298

You know that my means	700.0637
Well I went to a	507.1143

I was therefore obliged to	572.3605
The same evening some friends	61.0307

Feverish and excited I rang	22.1080
The person who opened it	519.7706
Mdah was standing at the	51.0240

A man who accustoms himself	1526.4250
But they are calling me	11.5083
Do you hear Ah Valentine	962.8107

Sight and hearing were the	1729.0122
Noirtiers hair was long and	1815.8444
He commanded with it it	139.1860
In short his whole appearance	886.0279
Three persons only could understand	800.6958
But as Villefort saw his	994.4703
Valentine by means of her	1097.6895
To this dumb language which	1396.1919
Valentine had solved the problem	886.2205
As to the servant he	458.8195
Villefort did not need the	559.9543
As we have said he	768.2304
He therefore allowed Valentine to	1258.9056

Provoked by a complete refusal	1034.8008

Valentine with a color still	621.9801
One look was sufficient to	561.7670
Dear grandpapa cried she what	24.1458
They have vexed you and	401.9001
Who has displeased you <PAD>	9.2262
Is it my father No	264.5363
Are you displeased with me	33.3554
M Noirtier again closed his	16.8343
And what have I done	182.7455
There was no answer and	76.5491
Has anyone been speaking to	234.9817
Let me think a moment	9.7555
I do assure you grandpapaAhM	14.6499

Pray forgive me But there	793.4134
Perhaps you think I shall	741.7096
Yes I understand said Valentine	163.8293
And you are afraid I	1221.7970
When I wished to retire	969.4224
Well continued Valentine the reason	1037.1521
Then the idea of this	50.5017
Ah if you could but	283.5761
But you are unable to	1430.3979
Alas you who would have	522.3221
However this is much and	1060.6575

What do you want with	42.9875
The invalids eye remained fixed	632.0933

Noirtier saw him seat himself	1039.0609
Threequarters of an hour after	78.4987
Sir said Villefort after the	557.1580
All his limbs have become	1979.3301
Sir said she I perfectly	933.5424
The first thing necessary to	1756.8777

Illness of body would not	1559.0247

It is very evident that	284.4469
Wait said Valentine and turning	909.0866
Valentine then took the dictionary	255.7454
She passed her finger slowly	1659.3848
Will said the notary it	906.3282
Really sir you must allow	422.5983
Yes said the procureur and	443.2639

Noirtier made a sign that	15.7681
Do you possess francs inquired	22.0846
Noirtiers eye remained immovable <PAD>	12.8693
The same expression continued <PAD>	10.1229

What said the notary do	1551.9576
It was not so much	1327.7097
But Noirtier looked at her	907.6659
Thank you thank you murmured	14.2773
The old mans declaration that	1001.5209

And you disinherit your granddaughter	1966.6885
The two notaries were holding	378.2664
Valentine was looking at her	1211.0715

Nothing sir it is a	383.4087

That is a serious thing	623.9067
Madame replied Villefort I can	748.2202
The name of father is	838.0639
But under the present circumstances	1076.6979
It would be ridiculous in	150.0066

But the count completely baffled	1787.5465
Although said Villefort it will	615.9444
He will perhaps hold me	1373.7452
Besides he knows that Valentine	554.6353
But it seems to me	568.2429
Poor Edward is as much	1029.5424
Count said Villefort we will	149.8511
It is true that my	1209.3945

I had often seen one	386.9898
I began to think of	2083.7319
Now it never occurred to	1593.1141
But one fine day I	1403.6040
At length I felt a	1306.6763
that of the home department	798.3641
Ma foi I should wish	2453.3733

At the foot of the	1600.2039

The count soon mastered the	1146.8152
No one would have thought	2948.8079
The garden was crossed by	2875.6926
This path was formed in	1347.7419
Never had Flora the fresh	3122.2480
In fact of the twenty	1378.7255
And yet it was not	1036.5371
There was not a blade	889.0182
Monte Cristo stopped after having	845.3320
The man at the telegraph	2518.3684
He had twelve leaves and	769.9166
You are gathering your crop	68.3849
Excuse me sir replied the	400.5598

This is the reason that	607.2910

Did you come here sir	38.1450
Yes if it isnt contrary	679.6781
Why do you like that	75.7708
I am a machine then	796.0965
That would spoil my plans	1395.5841
Will you go up with	650.6578
The tower contained implements such	1627.6394
The second was the mans	3397.8899
Does it require much study	192.5529
The study does not take	975.9948
They passed to the third	48.7723
Monte Cristo looked in turn	273.7200
It is very interesting he	235.3728
At first my neck was	622.1210
What did you say sir	18.8133
I was saying it was	139.4481
And you really understand none	1048.7284
Why should I But still	1021.6960
You will see said the	581.5580
My dear sir will you	796.8827

There you see it will	473.2432
As to the lefthand one	1566.1157
Now you are rich said	16.6612
Yes replied the man but	110.8826
I do not wish to	592.4672
Five minutes after the new	872.8417
Has your husband any Spanish	64.9233
I think so indeed <PAD>	9.1248
He has six millions worth	5245.3828
The idea of asking how	50.8303
The baroness did not wait	1192.0034
When it was seen that	106.1050
Danglars lost five hundred thousand	279.5970
The same evening the following	156.9223
The king Don Carlos has	1956.8253
Barcelona has risen in his	1005.3641

The king Don Carlos has	751.8703
A telegraphic signal improperly interpreted	4691.5977
This reckoning his loss and	527.3461
Good said Monte Cristo to	522.6889
I have just discovered how	865.6149
Ghosts At first sight the	1505.3203
The splendor was within <PAD>	10.7517
Indeed almost before the door	35.0369
M Bertuccio had outdone himself	816.1078
It is told that the	2136.9355
in three days M Bertuccio	4836.3027
For the rest the orders	623.5813
Thus the house had become	802.4406
The overseer would not have	731.2690
Bertuccio made amends however by	346.1817
What above all manifested the	792.8386
When the count arrived he	1110.4083
The servants passed gayly along	2598.1675
The library was divided into	2019.5760
On the other side of	1196.9855
One chamber alone had been	59.1561
Before this room to which	592.4590
At five oclock precisely the	219.3318

Certainly not replied the count	8.5847
No I should only regret	802.5730
See they are here And	1168.3545
The carriage drove round and	111.3951
The instant Debray had touched	71.9080
He offered his hand to	966.4574
But nothing escaped the counts	1929.5177
After his wife the banker	718.3249
Madame Danglars threw a rapid	1256.5260
The count understood him <PAD>	8.9699
Ah madame he said why	551.9887
If it were so with	661.9993
You understand now that if	565.7968
It seems to me said	1086.0076
Monte Cristo smiled at her	3666.0466
The baroness was astonished <PAD>	9.9705
Why said she you could	141.1720
How can such enormous jars	68.8213
madame replied Monte Cristo you	406.3561
It is the work of	1530.8130
Two broke from the heat	1077.2386
The sea knowing what was	2188.7781
At the end of two	440.5083
Divers descended in machines made	1559.5146
I am fond of these	2571.0774
When he had finished with	821.0497
He shuddered and rubbed his	110.9804
Sir said Monte Cristo to	1138.6044
No and yet they refused	66.6298
You pretend not to knowbecause	1266.4583
I think not replied ChteauRenaud	11.7310
Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and Count	64.4545

Madame Danglars looked at her	891.6292
The baron appears thoughtful today	1162.4984
More likely he has been	175.1947
and Madame de Villefort cried	17.2956
They entered <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.2965
M de Villefort notwithstanding his	1122.5593

After a short time the	549.0850

What do you want M	21.1460
Your excellency has not stated	2614.6824
The count watched him <PAD>	9.2113
Good heavens he exclaimed <PAD>	9.6407
What is the matter said	12.2806
That womanthat woman Which The	1699.6111
Waiting for whom Bertuccio without	1742.7351

Come calm yourself and reckon	32.3091

The Dinner It was evident	432.4359
Each one asked what strange	1064.5356
The recent events the solitary	2279.3521
And all present even including	734.8060
Madame Danglars had started when	958.6154
None of this had escaped	1163.2729

The repast was magnificent Monte	1644.3396
It was an Oriental feast	993.7223
Every delicious fruit that the	2874.9907
Rare birds retaining their most	8012.4844
Monte Cristo noticed the general	132.6591
Gentlemen he said you will	663.0137
Now to follow out this	167.2116
What is it that we	80.3544
Now to see things which	436.7032
I gratify my wishes by	80.5249

For example you see these	3375.6008

M <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8488
ChteauRenaud who has lived in	748.1823
And that one if I	64.3522
Now M Danglars ask these	1421.2074
Well this is just what	44.1605
I am like Nerocupitor impossibilium	190.7075
This fish which seems so	2107.0352
Each fish was brought over	3048.0835
You do not believe me	478.8568
Baptistin said the count have	953.9511
Four servants carried in two	1736.0137
But why have two of	35.8824
Merely because one might have	66.3123

It was also considered a	1094.6322

All this is very extraordinary	939.1829
Is it not true that	1091.1073
If I remember rightly it	1215.6417
I am fond of grass	55.7687
Yes said Madame de Villefort	411.8978
I recollect coming for my	1303.6025

Is it possible that you	1003.7264
Really if the house had	652.0278
Monte Cristo allowed a short	1195.8788
Perhaps the fellow had been	1122.3051
This house is part of	1009.8497
There was above all one	1191.1954

Monte Cristo waited for the	503.8481
They began by walking through	1876.8563
The drawingrooms were decorated with	3840.8042
At length they arrived at	27.9225
There was nothing particular about	839.8986
These two causes were enough	81.4356
Oh cried Madame de Villefort	902.3679
Many observations were made the	887.9951
Is it not so asked	16.0770
Look at that large clumsy	206.1578

Nothing she replied with a	20.6476
I want air that is	590.0538
No no she answered I	432.2840
Oh no sir said Madame	983.5135
Why should we not imagine	74.3519

And then you know he	689.3929
Yes before witnesses Oh this	1362.9182
Come this way gentlemen come	1527.6031
All the other guests followed	12.0002

A newly born infant repeated	2757.3484
This house was gloomy because	1074.9927
How <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8495

And pray what do you	1361.6222

Monte Cristo seeing that the	899.2888

Monte Cristo bowed and went	29.0761
I think Madame Danglars again	53.9757
But before Madame de Villefort	802.1866
Thanks my dear friend said	535.2347
The Beggar The evening passed	955.7190
On his wifes request M	192.9312
He offered a seat in	562.9171
As for M Danglars absorbed	1124.3250
While Monte Cristo had begged	665.4427
Without opposing their arrangements he	1379.8270
Danglars more and more delighted	235.0296
Andrea Cavalcanti found his tilbury	1132.9827
Andrea had spoken very little	1748.2859
Then he had been seized	1010.0529
He contemplated with unspeakable delight	2225.1584
Then after dinner on the	756.5531

Thus it was with much	795.1579
To this Cavalcanti replied by	760.2128
The major seated himself therefore	715.2982
As for Andrea he began	1085.3905
The groom heard him with	769.2344
At that moment a hand	25.0710
The young man turned round	778.4229
But instead of either of	1025.8998
A red handkerchief encircled his	5083.2480
Did the young man recognize	575.7161
We can not say but	244.9302
What do you want of	17.3150
Pardon me my friend if	383.5454

You have a quick horse	1543.1224
It was very polite of	898.6163
He urged the horse again	33.0244
You should not speak so	547.3116
Between people like us threats	236.6239
Is it my fault if	960.7987
Your tilbury your groom your	72.1638
Good so much the better	90.6075
Oh you knew that well	307.0774
If I had been wearing	1433.2689

What an appetite you used	19.0042
Is it as good now	54.2865
How did you come to	639.1732
I have no design upon	114.3078

A peer of France Ah	2696.8298
And now that you have	722.5837

No no my boy I	212.1588
Certainly as he had himself	343.2474
He drew up for a	1142.9452

Oh you are young while	51.2107
Au revoir Benedetto and running	66.6655
Alas said Andrea sighing one	162.9515
A Conjugal Scene At the	72.3465
the three young people separatedthat	1242.0475
Most probably Morrel and ChteauRenaud	1285.7711
When he reached the wicket	928.0946
Debray with the air of	530.4226
The gate once closed and	486.7819
and why were you so	924.2392
No Hermine replied Debray you	750.0995
M Danglars was disagreeable certainly	204.6033
Someone has vexed you I	1082.7273
Being a man who knew	836.3864
At the door of her	225.3537
What is my daughter doing	27.6720
She practiced all the evening	124.0634
Yet I think I hear	1462.3721

She has met Mademoiselle de	1319.2406
But tell me Well what	847.6929
What do you mean I	485.0520
The count is in fashion	445.2293
And did the eccentric person	579.2253
Elssler was dancing in Le	278.7507
After the cachucha he placed	1095.0791
And the Greek princesswill she	1054.1809
I wager anything said Albert	828.9525
It is not of him	26.9193
I was going to ask	739.6583
The son of a shipowner	1258.9069
Am I allowed to repeat	645.7776
Paris you can understand is	963.2120
Nothing more is wanting than	965.4045
And is he aware of	413.9817
When he arrives I will	1190.6355
Albert extended his hand <PAD>	9.2154
Madame said Albert allow me	780.6811
This answer and especially the	240.3830
But a recompense was in	1221.1831
The salutation was so well	746.3928
They might have remained much	369.7947
The Count of Monte Cristo	24.1606
We have already said that	416.4557
It was not the coat	1418.8314
Many men might have been	1696.5253
Everything about the count seemed	714.7916
Yet the Parisian world is	944.6805
Meanwhile he advanced through the	1931.7224
She turned towards him with	225.4605
No doubt she fancied the	495.9330
Have you seen my mother	18.3877
I have just had the	463.0228
I should not have guessed	13.9194
And for what kind of	40.2431
You know there are different	1714.5437
The thing was discussed for	181.4843
I can assure you the	560.5257
I suppose had he found	1078.4902
And who can that person	845.1332
I believe he thrusts pins	5933.2637
It seems That his experiments	1920.3215
And the other one demanded	15.5123
That one Yes the third	651.7086
He was very successful upon	22.5031
He stood badly with the	1088.4011
They talk of making him	1502.7235
And now you will do	408.3498
He turned round it was	14.7195
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
is it you baron said	11.3775
Why do you call me	216.4783
I am not like you	797.8724
Unfortunately said Monte Cristo ones	1130.5801
Yes I received the news	42.8587
I had about a million	1534.6764
Albert had left the count	472.8439
Meanwhile the heat became excessive	16.6622
The footmen were hastening through	209.9853
Monte Cristo wiped the perspiration	859.8035
Madame de Morcerf did not	873.1310
Albert she asked did you	1341.7567
Approach him said she and	1698.3910
Albert kissed his mothers hand	49.2227
Another salver passed loaded like	1974.4612
Albert rejoined his mother she	28.7971
Well said she you see	1604.0221
I should like to have	235.6600
Perhaps he can not reconcile	1039.7711
A minute afterwards the blinds	1902.1212
Dancers players talkers all uttered	1137.0836
At the same time Mercds	1360.4592
She went straight to the	105.9916
Do not detain those gentlemen	985.4250
It was only a momentary	686.2807
He offered his arm to	666.8988

It was too warm in	65.3484
Yes madame and it was	854.2543
But you he said with	907.7291
No madame replied Monte Cristo	709.5375
They reached the building ornamented	3206.9460
The countess left the arm	285.1467
See count she said with	840.5893
Do you refuse said Mercds	36.6136
Pray excuse me madame replied	1261.4998
A magnificent peach was hanging	727.0356
Mercds drew near and plucked	27.0398
Take this peach then she	16.1544
The count again refused <PAD>	10.6584
What again she exclaimed in	1510.6334
Count added Mercds with a	1653.9949
Certainly we are friends he	667.9197
Thank you she said <PAD>	6.8815
And they walked on again	12.1868
They went the whole length	74.1733
Sir suddenly exclaimed the countess	872.0081
But now you are happy	1364.3500
Are you not married asked	17.4984
I married exclaimed Monte Cristo	691.9651
I have adopted her as	798.6660
At Malta I loved a	1024.0840
I thought she loved me	490.0160
When I returned she was	13.9854
This is the history of	112.6601
Perhaps my heart was weaker	749.7047
Yes she said and you	1095.1115
Not at all why should	1058.1373
Take some she said <PAD>	7.8228
Madame I never eat Muscatel	598.2277
The countess dashed the grapes	241.6989
Inflexible man she murmured <PAD>	9.0048
Monte Cristo remained as unmoved	156.2407
Albert at this moment ran	13.3260
Oh mother he exclaimed such	52.5149
What has happened asked the	789.9946
Indeed I should expect misfortunes	18.5259
de Villefort is here Well	1309.5173
Madame de Villefort who was	910.5903
He was her grandfather on	25.9429
He was coming here to	379.2582
Why was not M de	703.9551
Ah count he esteems you	1370.8052
Monte Cristo watched her with	1274.2744
We are friends are we	20.9337
Oh madame I do not	872.1927
Do not my mother and	43.0328
On the contrary replied the	755.5343
It is perhaps needless to	156.1216
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
Madame de SaintMran A gloomy	324.9290
After the ladies had departed	1127.7307
But this time the papers	57.2962
Villefort had secluded himself not	671.9467
Then instead of plunging into	1395.5436
Their number was formidable now	1203.0275
When he had run over	2378.0259
No he murmured none of	1134.3828
Sometimes as Hamlet says Foul	5212.0137
The story has been told	346.1882
M de Monte Cristo may	923.7325
However among all the incoherent	953.7960
He dreaded not so much	2070.2410
While he was endeavoring to	1023.4933
He drew back the bolt	2030.5485
The white hair was thrown	2012.3367
Oh sir she said oh	35.4718
I shall die of it	954.0757
The servants standing in the	1289.2711
Villefort rose and ran towards	55.6033
Why what can have happened	76.9240
Is M de SaintMran with	17.2297
de SaintMran is dead answered	671.2515
Villefort drew back and clasping	2937.5791
M de SaintMran had been	1280.4060
At six leagues from Marseilles	1307.6891
However as it became dark	888.0785
I called the valet I	958.4682
Of course you sent for	675.1849
de SaintMran had always expressed	1340.7008
I had him put into	472.7542
my poor mother said Villefort	1314.5487
It is true that since	131.0111
I can not cry at	630.3389
Where is Valentine sir <PAD>	8.2480
It is on her account	551.8574
This instant sirthis instant I	82.4553
Villefort placed the arm of	257.3696
Rest yourself mother he said	10.3786
The marchioness raised her head	1698.2500
Villefort left her to the	1216.3827
Then while Madame de SaintMran	1871.2319
He was so pale when	595.7318
And grandpapa inquired the young	52.7285
M de Villefort only replied	71.3528
It was just in time	1202.2114
Who could have thought it	10.0497
Ah yes it is indeed	1622.8740
At the foot of the	65.3845
M <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8488
Noirtier wishes to see you	51.6031
Tell him I will come	776.5710
Valentine found her grandmother in	4494.1978
She soon whispered to her	582.0927
Yes yes she said softly	908.7377
Meanwhile Barrois had returned for	445.8286
Alas sir exclaimed Barrois a	45.5050
Madame de SaintMran has arrived	1154.9663
Noirtier let his head fall	1875.8114
Barrois asked Mademoiselle Valentine Noirtier	35.7753
She is at the ball	652.4125
Do you wish to see	84.5602
Well they have gone to	992.8631
Is that what you wish	34.5786
Barrois therefore as we have	236.6777
Consequently Valentine came up to	709.6924
Within reach of her hand	1381.3228
Then as we have said	120.8589
Valentine kissed the old man	1342.4281
The old gentleman continued to	85.1401
Yes yes said Valentine you	817.9365
Ah yes happily I have	22.0410
Without that what would become	78.8403
Barrois who wished to go	1000.6837
Noirtier would not say that	755.6320
The next morning she found	1245.4749
Oh dear grandmamma are you	250.1171
No my child no said	758.3138
Yes I wish to speak	819.6853
Sir said Madame de SaintMran	1296.9213
dpinay was quite a child	674.6689
Well sir said Madame de	733.1177
I know what I am	649.6420
I am all that is	758.7866
But this is not to	894.5894
It shall be as you	955.5937
You would not have me	2746.9417
I also was married at	692.6395
StillAlways <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8457
I tell you I am	39.8856
Well before dying I wish	37.2586
I wish to tell him	604.6309
The dead once buried in	672.1553
This night I have had	23.6772
It seemed as though my	1401.3490
It was the fever that	36.9053
Doubt if you please but	50.7101
I saw a white figure	800.2519
It was the soul of	1229.9900
the tie is even more	1257.6925
When does M dpinay return	169.6880
As soon as he arrives	24.4439
We must be expeditious <PAD>	10.7240
And then I also wish	761.0154
Oh how feverish you are	946.6366
The marchioness drained the glass	2124.0571
The poor child appeared herself	405.4058
A bright spot burned in	2980.9949
She was thinking of the	666.3937
More than once she thought	838.1323
Her secret had each time	987.8206
Two hours passed thus Madame	309.5498
Though his coming was announced	442.9685
The notary she exclaimed let	265.6357
Go Valentine said Madame de	2127.1240
Valentine instantly ran down <PAD>	11.4864
The doctor was a friend	316.7003
He had himself a daughter	778.7663
Oh said Valentine we have	166.0270
But first of all how	1005.2897
M dAvrigny smiled sadly <PAD>	13.2025
Antoinette is very well he	41.4811
But you sent for me	21.6775
It is not your father	1099.6310
M dAvrigny carried the science	1216.4999
No she replied it is	30.8840
You know the calamity that	251.9773
Alas said Valentine restraining her	78.4563
de SaintMran Yes Suddenly From	629.9125
Yes and my poor grandmother	975.9315
Oh M dAvrigny I beseech	858.0911
What are your grandmothers symptoms	3274.6570
It must have been delirium	1365.8634
Go upstairs she said to	16.6498
And you Oh I dare	1180.4572
I will go and take	828.7913
We need not say which	115.6546
After remaining for a short	1039.1362
As usual Valentine strolled for	377.7180
The mourning in her heart	1701.2115
She then turned towards the	16.9220
As she advanced she fancied	95.7032
She stopped astonished then the	638.8167
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Promise It was indeed	513.9625
With the instinct peculiar to	580.4711
His presentiments were realized as	1658.8666
Valentine was ignorant of the	597.7917
Morrel called her and she	26.9972
You here at this hour	16.4926
Yes my poor girl replied	874.5482
When are you to be	272.2843
This morning the subject was	1119.2043
Alas replied he it is	190.3775
The sentence is passed and	606.0797
But since you say nothing	823.2820
I was at the house	421.7721
Never till then had I	725.7914
At the sound of that	625.1140
The door at last opened	951.2307
Perhaps I turned pale and	1031.4365
Valentine the time has arrived	34.8842
And remember my life depends	33.7458
What do you intend doing	140.7717
Listen said Morrel it is	682.3373
There are such in the	1033.2195
Do you intend to struggle	39.4268
Tell me Valentine for it	300.3099
The idea of resisting her	322.1826
What do you say Maximilian	19.0467
What do you mean by	17.9475
Oh it would be a	14.8215
What <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8407
I resist my fathers order	71.3971
Impossible Morrel started <PAD> <PAD>	7.6209
You are too noble not	477.7590
No no I shall need	746.5883
But to grieve my fatherto	733.5891
In what a tone you	23.3750
I speak as one who	128.0089
Oh selfish man <PAD> <PAD>	7.9285
he sees me in despair	466.4630
You will not oppose M	773.1799
What would you have proposed	716.2047
Oh if you refuse my	705.2631
I am free replied Maximilian	64.6610
I swear to make you	1556.1133
Follow me said Morrel I	235.1719
We will embark for Algiers	1436.1553
I feared it Maximilian said	576.5219
Yesif I die Well Valentine	211.6875
Truly it is I who	364.5722
I appreciate your calm reasoning	19.5950
It is then understood that	1360.5728
What would you do tell	962.5092
I think only that I	56.0504
From the day I first	335.0884
One day you acknowledged that	1153.7570
Now I think no more	909.4313
It is an everyday occurrence	1167.3409
But in a word what	44.4081
I am going to have	646.3478
Adieu Valentine adieu said Morrel	20.3661
Where are you going cried	839.7684
Speak speak said Valentine I	1289.9371
Then adieu Valentine Valentine shook	855.7114
I must know what you	30.8253
Where are you going Oh	1027.0862
Another might threaten to seek	734.0264
What has M Franz to	18.5974
He saw me this morning	193.1477
He did not even know	683.0473
I have no enmity against	1322.7902
Valentine <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8424
Oh Heaven forbid <PAD> <PAD>	9.5102
Woman is sacred the woman	1255.3043
Maximilian said Valentine Maximilian come	1000.2848
Listen my dear my adored	819.2711
I never was romantic and	51.0985
I imitate neither Manfred nor	6303.0015
The moment you leave me	52.0563
My sister is happily married	1400.9287
This is what I shall	460.0746
I will then wait until	1497.9980
The young man stood before	49.2505
Oh for pitys sake said	585.1924
You have done your duty	1033.9213
Maximilian said she Maximilian my	773.9401
My God said Valentine raising	1189.2340
It is done cried she	1451.5496
Live Maximilian and I will	16.7416
Say when shall it be	9.7570
Speak command I will obey	1504.0769
Valentine said he dear Valentine	102.1222
Why should I obtain you	103.7281
Is it from mere humanity	51.3057
I would then rather die	725.0975
Who has consoled me in	32.3994
On whom do my hopes	17.6240
On whom does my bleeding	32.3721
On him on him always	15.0681
Yes you are right Maximilian	27.1391
I will leave the paternal	56.5814
Oh ungrateful girl that I	1155.1233
M Noirtier has evinced you	78.9573
Well before you leave tell	303.7888
As soon as we are	587.4533
You have told me how	694.6628
Now listen to me Maximilian	1859.9884
Yes we will wait replied	1795.8705
It is a miracle it	107.6821
If we were surprised if	1297.1984
I dread this marriage Maximilian	671.0374
When once I know the	802.9355
My adored Valentine words can	1566.9845
Adieu then till we meet	96.2219
I shall hear from you	1706.4592
Morrel listened to catch the	1177.1638
The young man returned home	558.0308
It was only on the	501.5311
It was to this effect	159.6923
Yesterday for two hours I	556.3822
Heaven is as inflexible as	547.4404
I have but one promise	510.5755
This evening then at a	48.6011
Your betrothed Valentine de Villefort	7222.4995
You will be very kind	596.7952
I think it is kept	826.5287
Then he went to call	57.8596
Franz had been to announce	618.6908
The day before Franz had	689.3242
It is easy to suppose	275.1505
Monte Cristo was more affectionate	984.4806
But he recalled the promise	96.4759
The young man read Valentines	125.8511
It was her first and	26.4036
Each time he read it	103.0922
How great is the power	149.8227
What devotion does she deserve	176.8908
How ought she really to	38.8822
She becomes at once a	393.7006
Morrel longed intensely for the	1293.0532
Occasionally he shuddered he thought	517.3932
When the afternoon arrived and	910.5995
He shut himself in his	1122.7360
At length the hour drew	17.2797
Never did a man deeply	166.4920
Morrel tormented his so effectually	134.0822
He then said It is	903.1547
The horse and cabriolet were	325.2050
The night gradually drew on	287.3394
Then Morrel came out from	889.4545
The clock struck halfpast eight	1907.9531
The garden became darker still	776.7673
The house which was discernible	1316.8210
Morrel looked at his watch	923.8356
This was already half an	80.0787
It was a terrible moment	22.6009
The slightest rustling of the	995.7624
Amidst all these alternations of	101.7999
It is impossible said Maximilian	1024.0244
I have weighed all the	1103.2449
Had Valentine fainted <PAD> <PAD>	8.3387
or had she been discovered	42.5229
These were the only obstacles	62.7809
The idea that her strength	566.9816
In that case said he	706.4930
He even thought he could	662.5081
At last the halfhour struck	13.8970
It was impossible to wait	2092.6218
He was on Villeforts premiseshad	93.2106
What might be the consequences	11.7766
However he had not ventured	50.0269
He followed a short distance	1155.3640
In a moment he had	97.0246
Then Morrel saw that he	161.6555
Instead of lights at every	1085.8683
A light moved rapidly from	228.6733
These three windows were in	43.6274
Another remained motionless behind some	276.4548
Morrel guessed all this <PAD>	9.3201
So many times in order	717.3603
This darkness and silence alarmed	177.1747
Almost mad with grief and	729.0046
At this sound as he	2313.7800
He had formed his resolution	12.4336
If it was Valentine alone	526.3174
The moon had just then	989.1635
They descended and advanced towards	810.5337
The young man seeing them	1461.7307
Soon the two gentlemen stopped	15.1656
Ah my dear doctor said	148.5196
What a dreadful deathwhat a	20.3934
Seek not to console me	1506.0958
Dead dead The cold sweat	342.5054
Who could be dead in	98.9967
My dear M de Villefort	440.0479
I mean that behind the	961.2533
What are you going to	1161.6251
Let us sit down Villefort	71.4911
The doctor stood before him	83.8302
Morrel horrified supported his head	1366.3115
Dead dead repeated he within	164.5003
Speak doctorI am listening said	2152.0132
Grief has consumed her said	47.1997
After living forty years with	1352.4266
Were you present during the	52.7372
I was replied the procureur	594.4688
Madame de SaintMran had three	1124.8354
When you arrived Madame de	1049.1836
Then I understood from your	124.2716
This crisis past I endeavored	110.7607
You held her handyou were	928.1345
This was more terrible than	1269.2908
Oh spare me That the	1961.4083
Morrel knew not if he	40.7716
Listen said the doctor I	351.8257
As a friend and only	34.0426
The similarity in the symptoms	2083.9119
And to that friend I	664.1686
Madame de SaintMran succumbed to	2153.4194

At the extremity of the	183.3543

It can not be wondered	1788.9270
Although it was impossible that	389.7145
This double error became an	2379.0908
Valentine had not seen him	9.3834
Her eyes raised towards heaven	3015.7803
Her poetic and excited mind	170.8658

Happily he did not meet	15.3915
Now especially did he find	645.5319
He turned back a door	656.9153
He pushed the door open	19.1609

Valentine perceived him without betraying	34.3954
A heart overwhelmed with one	164.9318
Morrel held out his hand	16.5201
Valentine as her only apology	1015.2752
Neither dared for some time	37.1091
They hesitated to break the	283.5908
My friend said she how	22.7695
Alas I would say you	501.0440
Morrel shuddered as he thought	353.2113
Your servants said he who	721.8016

Now said Valentine you can	660.5029
There is but one way	595.4106

Where asked Maximilian <PAD> <PAD>	7.1846
To my grandfathers room I	983.8311
Are you sure you are	870.2938
Barrois said Valentine shut the	150.2536
Noirtier seated in his chair	861.1686
There was something grave and	546.7357
Dear grandfather said she hurriedly	904.5753
To you alone then may	1613.1774
Look attentively then at this	753.0127
It is M Maximilian Morrel	794.8990
He brings an irreproachable name	1778.4349
Well grandpapa said Valentine kneeling	608.3105
You like M Maximilian Morrel	61.2578
Yes And you will protect	1005.2375
Mademoiselle said he you have	856.9102
Then he looked anxiously at	16.1791
Do you fear he will	707.6923
Valentine arose placed a chair	2488.2109
To prove to Noirtier that	1032.0939
But first said Morrel allow	552.2799
It was an imposing sight	2910.7644
His remarkably noble and austere	305.6101
He related the manner in	539.2089
He told him his birth	783.0190
This was our resolution a	663.7992
We must not do so	775.6629
The old mans interrogative eye	2004.8325
You wish to know what	136.5357
I will tell him the	870.4805
Still when Morrel had finished	924.9962
But what then must be	25.1709
Madame de SaintMrans last request	1374.5348
I understand said Morrel I	761.7764
Alone Valentine has no power	81.2687
I am here almost miraculously	485.0735
Believe me there are only	554.4597
Do you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine	1901.1954
No From you Yes You	47.1554
Pardon my eagerness for my	57.0140

Will you assure me it	65.7973
The contract shall not be	31.4524
Oh pardon me sir I	102.7168
Will they not sign it	29.2507
Notwithstanding that assurance Morrel still	20.2179
This promise of an impotent	619.7381
Is it not natural that	460.2912
The weak man talks of	1880.4280
Whether Noirtier understood the young	1476.0944
What do you wish sir	1491.5255
Shall I swear to you	21.7123
Yes said the paralytic with	24.0791
Morrel understood that the old	99.5920

And the drawers Yes Those	1337.8353

Obey said Noirtiers intelligent eye	16.2392
Barrois touched a spring the	1762.2894

Do you wish him to	23.7248
Yes replied the old man	9.3843
You understand baron my grandfather	118.8313
Then let us sit down	785.6988
Villefort took a chair but	1132.1030
Read said the old man	8.6253
Franz untied it and in	727.7792
February said he it is	391.4550

A note was in consequence	1273.5673
The note indicated neither the	940.6530

At nine oclock the president	732.0516
General de Quesnel accepted the	737.9395

What must be done then	144.9797
Have you then so much	583.0271
When they were seated in	490.7851
On the road the president	696.8248
Sure enough said the general	10.4633
The carriage stopped at an	118.1744

Opinions held in common are	365.4954

Well asked the president what	628.6879
to break my vow in	1458.1510
General said the president we	1666.0232
The communication has been made	386.4819
Now we discover our error	662.8133
We will not constrain you	1036.1096
You see I am more	218.5228
I understand now why they	2188.7227
Villefort walked to and fro	22.3852
Noirtier watched the expression of	193.3761
Franz returned to the manuscript	847.5054
When you complied with this	1505.1445
It would be conceding too	662.7017
No no you must first	612.0026
The president again arose and	1688.5354
M dpinay became very pale	1768.4058
General said the president do	921.0816
The same deadly silence succeeded	33.2947
Then the general advanced and	831.5738
But he does wrong to	31.4724
Follow my advice swear and	1337.9623
It is thisI swear by	557.1152
Now am I at liberty	35.2793
The president rose appointed three	1384.0160
One of those three members	100.4199
The other members silently dispersed	21.2198
Where do you wish to	275.0865
Beware sir replied the president	475.6487
They were at that part	512.2166
Why do you stop here	22.7992
Because sir said the president	733.6157
Make no noise sir unless	547.3600
You are alone one alone	529.9033
Now if you please remove	293.8684
At last said he I	334.2012
Valentine clasped her hands as	31.8481
Noirtier looked at Villefort with	135.7667
Franz continued It was as	51.7023

One of the seconds went	751.9180

Still he had not even	22.9822
General dpinay died five minutes	2201.9314

His first look was certainly	174.3956
As for his wife he	799.7175

Alas no sir replied Andrea	237.4653
Danglars immediately advanced towards the	30.5297

The baroness took advantage of	1481.0260
Albert bowed with a smile	681.3145
Cavalcanti was evidently embarrassed he	297.8944
Then Albert launched out in	860.0852
Cavalcanti being left alone turned	26.7053
Come said Madame Danglars leave	1295.4304
They passed into the next	63.7887
Just as they were beginning	865.8411
Monte Cristo observed it particularly	166.2556
I have just received my	60.3376

Danglars cast another suspicious look	1375.1018

But apropos of Debray how	896.6854
Where have you come from	31.5411

Ma foi my dear viscount	1656.5048
Are there then really women	1203.8051
Hayde is a very uncommon	937.8475
Only think then if Mademoiselle	2373.6099
She is very amiable then	37.8206
It is not to be	952.8477
Are there any more slaves	1176.8450
The slave of the Count	20.9324
Why it is a rank	440.3145
The poor girl originally possessed	1956.4717

Tell Hayde said he that	490.1599
Now understand me said the	632.8989
Let us go in said	16.3412
Albert passed his hand through	1418.7157
Ali was stationed as a	879.2845
Hayde was awaiting her visitors	181.9105
Her large eyes were dilated	874.4748
She was sitting on a	760.4321
Near her was the instrument	1148.5133
On perceiving Monte Cristo she	1098.9307
Monte Cristo advanced towards her	295.0816
Albert had proceeded no farther	1261.5642
Whom do you bring asked	572.1990
What is his name Count	514.2675
Do you know modern Greek	22.1091
Alas <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8417

You will speak in Italian	16.1317
Then turning towards AlbertIt is	2488.3354
Sir she said to Morcerf	400.0456
Then turning to Ali she	912.0065
Monte Cristo and Morcerf drew	2194.4045
Ali then entered bringing coffee	1003.3015
Albert refused the pipe which	45.0631
Oh take ittake it said	1054.3553
The cups of coffee were	524.3365
Monte Cristo and Hayde took	517.2260
Hayde took the porcelain cup	1673.9545
At this moment two women	4219.5293
My dear host and you	237.2240
I am quite bewildered and	81.7472
Here I am in the	392.5378
Oh signora if I could	1826.9003
Just what you please you	749.5678
At what age did you	65.2130
I left it when I	71.4041
And have you any recollection	643.8928
The mind can see as	29.7447
The body forgets sometimes but	2680.3484
Then you remember everything that	401.4704
Everything Count said Albert in	625.2299
You prohibited my mentioning my	1220.9630
What are you saying to	48.0696
I again reminded her that	633.2726
Under the oldest and thickest	1222.4340
Then from time to time	624.6959
And how does France appear	1411.1841
You wish me then to	127.3710
I beg you to do	21.1107
Well I was but four	257.7781
We were in the palace	697.8493
She took me away without	17.1184
When I saw her weeping	45.2633
Hush child said she <PAD>	8.3222
At other times in spite	2177.2246
She bore me rapidly away	15.4108
I saw then that we	2981.6062
Behind the women came a	961.8205
You may imagine there was	2053.4722
Here and there on the	842.6416
Quick said a voice at	26.7894
This voice made everyone bow	2283.6516
As for me it made	17.6077
This voice was that of	13.9682
He came last clothed in	1060.3743
He was leaning on the	803.9756
My father said Hayde raising	1860.4728
Soon said Hayde we halted	473.3941
My mother pressed me to	707.4112
Four marble steps led down	1128.3666
From where we stood I	926.6522
This kiosk appeared to me	602.8708
We stepped into the boat	12.6470
I remember well that the	1230.3484
The Palikares had remained on	1442.9860
Our bark flew before the	22.7314
Why does the boat go	68.6194
Silence child <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4239
Hush we are flying I	25.2686
Why should my father flyhe	2073.7039
I have been told since	1368.2244
The young girl then continued	2370.1016
You were saying signora said	1325.4673
No said she I do	568.5426
It was towards this kiosk	43.0383
A ground floor ornamented with	2457.9165
But beneath the ground floor	1213.2806
In this place were together	1469.8068
Near the barrels stood Selim	259.7359
He stood watch day and	1055.5707
I remember well that the	1623.0807
As for me I can	737.4878
I can not tell you	648.2878
Sometimes but very rarely my	671.1138
My father was endeavoring to	3590.9138
The heights of Pindus towered	2510.7583
One morning my father sent	765.7172
Take courage Vasiliki said he	553.6468
If my pardon be complete	2241.5864
Oh make yourself easy on	1103.5474
They would be glad to	730.7855
She prepared the iced water	1355.6569
Presently he made such a	100.0341
Then without taking his eyes	507.7473
My mother gave it him	637.0776
I saw my fathers hand	19.4533
A boattwothree murmured my fatherfour	540.7720
Vasiliki said he to my	275.9297
In the space of half	106.4063
Go into the cavern with	896.4811
Adieu my lord murmured my	209.1853
Take away Vasiliki said my	37.9855
As for me I had	1015.9769
Oh how distinctly I remember	685.1307
On descending we saw through	1382.3242
At first they appeared like	1051.0178
During this time in the	1612.6067
They were armed with their	3644.4443
My father looked at his	583.0660
This was the scene which	545.6741
My mother and I traversed	88.6089
Selim was still at his	123.4212
We fetched our cushions from	329.1342
In great dangers the devoted	1341.6902
As to Hayde these terrible	1441.6050
Monte Cristo looked at her	110.1596
Go on my child said	45.5323
Hayde looked up abruptly as	1449.3710
It was about four oclock	977.6655
One single solitary light was	1321.8658
My mother was a Christian	28.0771
Selim repeated from time to	679.3486
As she was coming down	782.4062
She advanced some steps towards	40.6198
They are approaching said she	1246.8059
If they do not bring	1003.9614
My mother experienced the same	83.2603
Mamma mamma said I are	817.2137
My child said Vasiliki may	1820.4844
If he send me his	871.5982
Suddenly we heard loud cries	227.4808
The name of the French	1332.4131
Monte Cristo made a sign	32.1803
I do not recollect it	19.6867
The noise increased steps were	1068.8612
Selim made ready his lance	14.4645
Soon a figure appeared in	736.9377
Who are you cried Selim	11.6895
But whoever you may be	677.7369
He grants a full pardon	985.7183
Stop said Selim seeing that	587.0258
And she fell on her	1405.4786
Monte Cristo poured a little	1055.9075
Selim had also recognized him	404.8533
In whose name do you	28.2317
I come in the name	821.2307
I do not see what	51.7194
Approach then said the messenger	837.4866
Oh how our hearts palpitated	504.7397
But was it my fathers	14.9447
that was the question <PAD>	7.1917
Selim still holding in his	1102.4240
It is well said he	1040.0245
The messenger uttered a cry	78.4458
At this signal four soldiers	1385.6113
Each man had stabbed him	1617.5216
At this moment my mother	2236.3359
The lower rooms were entirely	474.0890
Just as my mother was	575.2145
My mother applied her eye	1769.7833
What do you want said	785.6299
What we want replied one	96.6449
Do you see this firmanI	32.1363
Well read it he demands	1622.2876
The Palikares who were prostrated	1335.1606
At the same instant the	759.3382
Oh how noble did the	1030.0751
and how he terrified them	111.4120
Selim Selim cried he guardian	902.7969
Three or four Palikares fell	249.3984
My father howled aloud plunged	1354.1573
But immediately through this opening	1888.3846
In the midst of all	3201.7783
These two shots had mortally	971.6373
However he remained standing clinging	29.0971
My mother tried to force	501.7031
All around him were lying	2532.5688
At this crisis the whole	1295.3162
I felt myself fall to	1192.2336
Monte Cristo arose and approached	857.0495
Then patting the young girl	1475.6833
Hayde saw at a glance	1621.0920
Kill said she but spare	522.1120
To whom thenTo your new	2214.9197
Then said Albert you became	656.3933
We traversed Greece and arrived	112.7928
They were surrounded by a	783.1415
I was taken to the	108.2839
He caused me to be	946.0879
Come finish your cup of	200.7721
We hear From Yanina If	1495.9537
Villefort had only just given	1441.8202
M dpinay must say that	680.8621
And in justice to Villefort	671.2300
This harsh letter coming as	1448.1344
Hardly had he read the	35.6914
The sudden departure of Franz	1253.6814
Determined to bear it no	874.8702
M de Villeforts communications on	1380.0304
This was an awkward and	214.6460
She therefore contented herself with	1320.2916
This news false as it	1239.8073
During this time Valentine at	1704.5026
Noirtier looked the permission which	23.5798
But instead of going to	1154.6194
In the midst of all	939.7671
She expected every moment that	1178.9833
It was high time for	612.1597
He had half guessed what	518.4631
He followed M dpinay saw	438.2343
He had no longer any	598.7950
He was not mistaken peering	1663.5846
The first glance which Maximilian	1553.1814
We are saved said Valentine	11.6894
Saved repeated Morrel not being	537.4777
Oh Morrel pray love him	784.0730
But tell me Valentine how	50.0437
What strange means has he	1032.6949
However he would not leave	134.7712
Valentine promised all that Morrel	648.6688
During the time occupied by	743.9826
The old man looked at	597.8746
Sir said she it is	694.6780
But one thing I can	281.9054
Now that this marriage which	502.5366
I come to entreat you	483.0064
May I hope sir said	902.8563
In that case sir rejoined	1577.5742
The next day M Noirtier	611.1861
It was then generally reported	1011.7303
While all the proceedings relative	732.6172
Danglars was balancing his monthly	1121.4481
At the first sight of	610.5400
Morcerf usually so stiff and	2209.8865
Well baron said he here	917.5629
To what do you allude	950.4033
Ah said Morcerf I see	528.6374
Ma foi I beg your	402.2068
What I mean to say	1712.1769
Have you so soon changed	760.4814
I am not without a	86.1721
What do you mean to	377.6483
A cloud settled on his	2764.9438
My dear Danglars said Morcerf	1254.7728
You owe me an explanation	1114.7555
And towards whom do you	452.1637
The expression of the counts	735.6337
Is it Madame de Morcerf	33.1561
Is it my fortune which	27.2081
Is it because my opinions	1213.1737
No do not seek any	45.6307
I really am quite ashamed	1886.0198
Ma foi there is no	18.7362
My daughter is only seventeen	87.6249
While we wait time will	1688.8809
Does anyone dare to slander	1333.1885
Danglars observed that during the	929.8616
That evening he had a	547.4179
The next morning as soon	949.2148
He hastily tore off the	3662.0247
When he presented himself at	749.6594
Did he take Baptistin with	827.4778
My good friend said Albert	892.9634
Out even to me I	601.0627
Do you think it will	497.2060
Albert left the cab in	499.0482
As he was passing the	2178.1550

Yes sir replied the coachman	10.8667
While he was speaking Albert	129.3399
He entered and on his	31.3847

People fight for all sorts	905.6552
Ali bring me some water	1183.5034
Come in my lord said	749.3066
At a distance Albert thought	458.6657
Ah ha said Albert I	669.6616
Those are really aces and	5411.0586
In fact the bullets had	2521.2280
In going up to the	1775.2493
Diable said Morcerf <PAD> <PAD>	6.4110
What would you have my	849.2756
But come I am waiting	907.3089

The castle which formed the	1163.0350

They have allowed all this	1061.8608
I inherit my fathers name	514.8553
I am going to Beauchamp	1611.5352
I will efface that blot	59.4242
My father who was such	1956.6658
If ones lot is cast	244.0090
I shall perhaps find myself	2461.7073
Well if so why do	498.0101
Supposing for instance and do	691.1094
If Beauchamp be disposed to	723.4315
If on the contrary he	812.6327
When you wish to obtain	1548.2220
Goodbye count Morcerf took his	38.0265
He found his carriage at	693.7551
It was a gloomy dustylooking	669.0954
The servant announced M Albert	25.2235
Beauchamp repeated the name to	754.6442
Albert entered <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.3039
Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of	1748.2367
This way this way my	178.1806
Are you out of your	193.8452
Try and find a seatthere	569.6595
What do you wish to	838.3569
But pray sit down Thank	218.1689
Will you now have the	904.6374
Baptiste give me yesterdays paper	29.9450

Beauchamp took the paper and	167.5815
You see it is a	438.6938

Yes said Albert blushing <PAD>	10.2120
Well what do you wish	71.9154
My dear Beauchamp I wish	545.4629

Sit down and I will	796.5389

But wait a moment do	183.2473

Fernand Mondego Count of Morcerf	3358.6685
Then I can well understand	49.8336
I will look at it	933.5834
But the paper nowhere identifies	1261.4661
You will retract this assertion	421.5734
Yes replied Beauchamp <PAD> <PAD>	7.0949
Immediately said Albert <PAD> <PAD>	6.1772
When I am convinced that	1065.9238
If you do not believe	366.3806
Sir replied he if you	500.7309

You insist on my contradicting	1533.4862
And if I refuse to	322.1789
Yes replied Albert raising his	16.5262
Well said Beauchamp here is	38.9056
The article was not inserted	602.4478

Now I am going to	183.6398

But I require three weeks	734.5860
Albert de Morcerf said Beauchamp	858.5723
Today is the of August	585.9767
Albert vented his anger on	2368.4612
While Albert was lashing the	434.7223
He was passing the Chinese	757.5863
Ah said Morcerf there goes	471.0856
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Lemonade Morrel was in	34.5222

He had therefore set off	1366.8466
Morrel advanced with a firm	387.6260
Morrel was only thirtyone Barrois	1569.9940
These two men thus opposed	3180.5999
This point of union was	409.1867
On arriving at the house	1480.3384
The old servant introduced Morrel	768.2443
She looked marvellously beautiful in	2448.5195
But the easychair of the	507.1786
Noirtier acknowledged by a look	2050.4243
Morrel then cast on the	1170.8173
Valentine was sitting at a	746.2152
Noirtier fixed his eyes on	13.9004
Am I to say what	30.5097
Noirtier made a sign that	27.4578
Monsieur Morrel said Valentine to	830.8833
I will repeat them then	682.6374
My grandfather intends leaving this	1417.9062
My apartment will be close	17.4825
Now M de Villefort must	820.7714

And with my grandfathers consent	1129.7474
Have I not explained your	84.1476
Yes looked the old man	9.8010
Once under my grandfathers roof	1077.2135
But alas I have heard	1738.4906
Noirtier regarded the lovers with	1012.2192
How hot you look my	40.2095
Ah I have been running	749.5543
The decanter was nearly full	599.0566
Come Barrois said the young	756.2115
Valentine and Morrel were exchanging	715.2706
It was the signal of	14.5893
Valentine looked at her watch	11.8674

He acknowledged the extreme kindness	869.7826
Danglars listened with the most	822.0757
He would not however yield	554.2792
Are you not rather young	617.9407
Life is so uncertain that	1223.9288
So important a negotiation should	1080.0656
Thinking that I might wish	792.0881
So far as I can	636.1263
We should command an annuity	30.8789

As the last stroke died	921.0794
A firm and wellpractised hand	1008.0225
The count felt his heart	35.1294
Inured as men may be	802.5087
However Monte Cristo only made	1243.2344

Suppose a watchman should pass	79.1485
He then descended but it	528.3287
Monte Cristo returned to his	692.4991

Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly	380.1573
No one could be seen	18.8799
The clock of the Invalides	23.0747

But three weeks had already	1572.6697
It was expected that this	691.7150

With an instinctive hatred of	3490.3149
The baron might possibly have	400.5325
The delay demanded by Beauchamp	46.8451
Morcerf appreciated the advice of	302.4028
No one had taken up	502.5183
Albert however felt no less	1156.9430
Besides the manner in which	288.9190
He cherished the thought of	525.3315
Beauchamp had not been seen	633.9282
Where he was no one	12.0297
One morning Albert was awakened	161.8541
Albert rubbed his eyes ordered	1660.9491
He found Beauchamp pacing the	84.0090

After a moments mournful silence	407.1591
Beauchamp who had watched with	262.8397

But on the contrary the	1164.1670

Then seeing the young man	886.1335

Madame Danglars asked me for	931.4934
But what is the matter	12.3823

You see then said Albert	1583.7351
You are certainly a prodigy	1149.8158
But passing his hand across	1588.7142
Bertuccio said he I intend	277.2249
You will have sufficient time	938.8404
M de Morcerf will accompany	1714.1938
From Pontoise another express was	1220.5515
Before his departure the count	674.4785
Albert was punctual <PAD> <PAD>	7.6914
The journey soon became interesting	502.9544
Truly said Monte Cristo with	938.3481
The carriage rolled with a	938.2206

Who then has so correctly	790.9565
This news was brought to	14.0729
A man arrived yesterday from	3406.3354

Everyone had arrived almost before	828.7640
Some were perusing the article	1097.6910
The Count of Morcerf was	49.3641
Like all upstarts he had	439.0178
The true nobility laughed at	545.9120
He was in fact in	954.0357
The Count of Morcerf alone	40.0944
He did not take in	815.8265
He arrived at his usual	1466.4375
Business had already been going	88.6833
Everyone held the accusing paper	880.2649
At length an honorable peer	2925.2490
There was an impressive silence	1528.9324
The count did not notice	1109.7615
Moral wounds have this peculiaritythey	2618.9075
The article having been read	3054.3774
He stated his scruples and	417.5655
He concluded by calling for	1480.0144
Morcerf was so completely overwhelmed	1276.1156
This timidity which might proceed	1473.3230
The president put it to	262.8027
The count was asked what	81.8813
Morcerfs courage had revived when	177.8482
My lords answered he it	942.1016
Oh that I could instead	1152.8656

But said the count so	1136.6353
And what effect did this	97.9912
I acknowledge it affected me	117.4900
Meanwhile the president carelessly opened	719.4156

Speak Morcerf did not reply	12.2197
Then all the members looked	47.3562
They knew the counts energetic	1629.2467
They expected that his stupefied	161.0100
Well asked the president what	497.4934
Has the daughter of Ali	76.2776
Is she then the terrible	319.3908
Have you really committed the	853.4237
Then he raised his eyes	990.6499
Then with a hasty movement	1154.6503
Gentlemen said the president when	1517.6694
Hayde had remained until the	29.0381
She heard the counts sentence	2424.7524
The Challenge Then continued Beauchamp	867.6716
The usher who had introduced	596.2379
I left with mingled feelings	48.5384
Excuse me Albertsorrow on your	559.6081
Yes Albert from whatever source	1075.3059
I can not calmly say	938.0529
I rely on your friendship	1798.8401
How does this misfortune affect	18.4444
No happily that unjust prejudice	489.5258
Review your life Albert although	2700.4910
No Albert take my advice	12.7358
You are young and richleave	985.8495
You will return after three	1082.8269
I have told you my	45.7222
You understand that interested as	398.6905
What appears to you to	1041.9703
Providence appears to me to	1112.8960
Now I repeat Beauchamp I	628.6370
Each moments delay is an	35.7028
The calumniator is not yet	562.8475
At the first word before	151.7685
I guess what brings you	1550.0089
He the man who would	741.5607
Oh no he was afraid	716.8306
Act prudently Oh do not	77.7565
Beauchamp solemn transactions should be	66.6328
Before this day closes if	519.6598
Pardieu Beauchamp mine shall be	1590.0383
Do you wish to go	18.3917
Let us go immediately They	45.8707
On entering the bankers mansion	296.4759
Ah <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8468
parbleu thats good said Albert	38.7807
If M Danglars will not	1159.7256
It was however too late	961.9805
Sir cried the latter am	320.0914
You appear to forget yourself	1512.8075
And you too said he	436.7209
Alberts attack on Andrea had	1089.7108
Indeed sir said he to	490.9634
In one respect you are	771.3865
Now if you are mad	209.5605
Is it my fault that	1768.5610
My fault said he you	23.2342
What do I know of	22.9119
Have I travelled in that	15.1134
Did I advise your father	1095.7701
No it is not you	1167.2452
How came it known I	926.3946
Who wrote for particulars concerning	2867.2158
It appears to me that	445.8207
I assure you cried Danglars	1274.6105
Tell me Pardieu it was	64.3601
I was speaking of your	31.5532
I said the origin of	38.8703
The person to whom I	394.4509
I answered In GreeceThen said	1667.2026
Sir said Beauchamp who had	707.4800
When the day after the	465.0335
In short why should I	73.6512
How did the honor or	87.3490
It neither increased nor decreased	1817.0881
Danglars defended himself with the	660.7227
Besides what was Morcerf seeking	12.4306
It was not whether Danglars	624.4439
In addition to this everything	339.6635
Monte Cristo knew everything as	1027.6471
The answer known he had	906.7622
Besides had he not begged	167.1398
Lastly he had taken Albert	181.3724
There could be no doubt	799.6351
Albert took Beauchamp aside and	58.6884
You are right said the	16.5247
Danglars has only been a	671.0051
Sir said he to Danglars	430.5139
Danglars accompanied him to the	1268.2374
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
The Insult At the bankers	61.6750
Listen said he just now	528.8308
The other is on the	477.8338
My only fear is that	601.8928
The happiest thing that could	1163.7141
Champslyses <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8473
Beauchamp wished to go in	749.3674
The cause which the young	863.8546
Albert sprang from the porters	37.5680
He was received by Baptistin	12.2079
The count had indeed just	686.9905
But after his bath asked	19.0218
My master will go to	1228.1428
Quite sir my master has	1183.1333
I depend on you to	773.5280
On his return home Albert	729.2087
Then he went to see	456.2384
He found her in bed	123.8409
The sight of Albert produced	1830.3018
Albert stood one moment speechless	94.6023
It was evident from his	1013.8316
My dear mother said he	785.0828
Those who are known are	246.3316
You are of so superior	1062.5842
M <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8488
de Monte Cristo she exclaimed	608.5766
Who told you so <PAD>	7.7977
Why you are mad Albert	11.2810
M de Monte Cristo has	44.6255
M de Monte Cristo saved	96.8293
Oh I entreat you my	1135.6720
Yes doubtless and is it	855.7175
What has the count done	9.9117
Three days since you were	890.3541
Mercds saw it and with	840.2206
Albert was silent an instant	1460.0887
You should install yourself here	61.6719
I do not wish to	762.7108
Scarcely had he shut her	1156.2552
Then she rang for her	1262.2074
The footmans mission was an	29.5706
Albert went to his room	43.8971
At ten minutes to eight	699.9248
Both got into Alberts coup	809.3534
ChteauRenaud was at his post	336.4776
The conduct of the son	1010.0886
Debray was not yet come	282.5964
Albert wandered about the theatre	87.7361
He hoped to meet with	283.6152
The bell summoned him to	216.3381
But his eyes scarcely quitted	1337.5222
At last as Albert was	640.1798
Morrel followed him and looked	1277.3569
The count in his survey	1314.9637
He recognized Albert but thought	395.3550
Without communicating his thoughts to	608.6166
Although apparently not noticing Albert	815.2762
Then his head was seen	478.5342
He was at the moment	394.8661
The door opened and Monte	516.0587
Well cried he with that	1384.6285
Goodevening M de Morcerf The	1789.0405
Morrel only then recollected the	964.2865
We are not come here	1854.1414
An explanation at the Opera	964.6949
Little acquainted as I am	472.8649
Thus the attention of many	50.4348
Where are you come from	12.4242
said Monte Cristo You do	1019.3369
I do not understand you	274.6386
I am at home here	315.7975
Leave the box sir Monte	197.7785
Ah I shall know how	1205.8962
Well well said Monte Cristo	617.2601
It is in poor taste	76.6260
Display is not becoming to	1079.1101
They had talked of no	49.4936
Albert understood the allusion in	638.6364
But Monte Cristo without rising	1676.5259
Now leave me or I	940.6813
Monte Cristo took up his	734.4371
Morrel whispered What have you	26.1167
Nothingat least personally said Monte	18.3086
But there must be some	1566.0120
I had been told but	543.2037
Albert wrote to request me	558.3779
But what shall you do	279.6828
As certainly Maximilian as I	1132.4242
Ah count said he his	424.8926
Count count said he <PAD>	7.0143
Dear Maximilian interrupted the count	832.4395
idole de mon me I	468.8553
Bravo bravo Morrel saw it	96.6349
The curtain which had risen	743.9514
Come in said Monte Cristo	306.6788
Goodevening M Beauchamp said Monte	460.1667
I am happy to see	733.9264
And having done so entirely	1183.8794
Then I will add two	468.5726
Come said he laughing there	313.6736
Doubtless you wish to make	67.7484
I am in your opinion	1406.0919
You bring me down to	86.7792
Indeed M Beauchamp it is	1518.3114
Beauchamp interposed this strange man	600.5445
Say no more I entreat	13.4327
I do what I please	780.7515
I require honorable guaranties I	1996.2091
Tell the viscount so and	625.5743
It is quite immaterial to	628.2911
In France people fight with	904.5537
Tell your client that although	1007.1644
Certainly said Monte Cristo slightly	461.3037
I shall kill himI can	35.9768
Only by a single line	452.9487
Very well sir said Monte	14.0513
Now all that is settled	624.7063
Now said Monte Cristo turning	694.3309
Do you think Emmanuel would	137.0604
that is all I require	10.2995
Tomorrow morning at seven oclock	556.0409
Listen <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8460
I never lose a note	1487.3473
The Night Monte Cristo waited	3076.0149
Morrel took leave of him	609.4545
Then he stepped into his	251.0071
No one who knew the	819.8585
These were pistols of an	1191.9170
A cap was sufficient to	893.0635
He was just taking one	929.4693
Before he had spoken a	749.0615
Baptistin looked at his master	375.0825
Who are you madame said	38.5777
The stranger cast one look	1023.2839
What name did you pronounce	54.1833
Yours cried she throwing back	183.4976
Edmond it is not Madame	473.1716
You see Edmond I am	763.7695
I guessed all I followed	996.5980
Oh for pitys sake You	887.6581
It is not I who	1239.3096
Why do you remember when	22.1080
What are Yanina and its	38.0243
What injury has Fernand Mondego	2315.7192
It does not concern me	513.8809
And why were you alone	622.8304
Why was I a prisoner	34.5115
You do not madame at	27.6339
But I will tell you	8.8036
I was arrested and became	924.0017
It was Danglars letter to	602.9346
Mercds read with terror the	1153.5221
Ample corroboration of this statement	2145.0107
Should it not be found	830.0485
You do not know that	591.0648
You do not know that	793.6302
That is what I heard	604.1664
Compared with such things what	1118.7839
Well the French did not	1304.6659
He sends me for that	1513.1979
Forgive Edmond forgive for my	1180.1627
Her forehead almost touched the	192.3878
Then seated on a chair	1242.3033
Not crush that accursed race	488.6750
Impossible madame impossible Edmond said	904.9567
Well yes you are right	675.7662
Oh Mercds I have uttered	686.4807
Mercds I must revenge myself	1642.5420
Revenge yourself then Edmond cried	808.6066
Since God himself dictated those	1857.8708
Edmond my friend do not	1689.5792
Edmond if you knew all	494.5775
Yes dead alas <PAD> <PAD>	8.5388
I imagined your dead body	1496.9142
What could I do for	61.6784
Listen for ten years I	73.9193
I had been told that	389.7933
Well Edmond I swear to	667.3569
And I too Edmondoh <PAD>	10.3115
believe meguilty as I wasoh	1032.9254
The lion was daunted the	48.2256
What do you ask of	51.3846
Well he shall live Mercds	1581.2147
Oh said she seizing the	575.4521
Now you are exactly what	142.1026
Oh now I may say	647.5679
Death is about to return	636.8741
and why so <PAD> <PAD>	6.9031
Who talks of dying <PAD>	10.7906
Whence have you these ideas	1030.2476
What I most loved after	976.3387
With one word you have	821.2099
While waiting his assistance I	535.2158
Mercds extended her hand to	15.9260
Edmond said she and her	900.0276
Ah believe me Edmond as	810.8460
No it is not finished	100.0123
Oh I repeat it Edmond	1008.9973
Suppose that the Supreme Being	2046.7552
Monte Cristo pressed his forehead	1220.9956
Edmond said Mercds I have	216.3680
Edmond continued she you will	639.9866
Adieu then Edmond I have	586.8444
Adieu Edmond adieu and thank	75.1742
Mercds opened the door of	663.6963
The clock of the Invalides	1154.3728
What a fool I was	512.5645
The Meeting After Mercds had	242.0689
Around him and within him	924.4882
What said he to himself	885.4699
this edifice which I have	994.4182
Yes this self of whom	730.8988
Alas it is not the	440.8254
What is death for me	9.6138
One step farther into resttwo	55.7703
No it is not existence	1609.5177
Providence is now opposed to	139.4921
It is not Gods will	42.1902
This burden almost as heavy	555.7400
Oh shall I then again	1510.7314
And all thisall this because	1347.6545
Yet continued the count becoming	1186.7874
There are virtues which become	49.7975
No she must have conceived	1735.9889
Ridiculous repeated he and the	39.7094
I ridiculous <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	6.2789
No I would rather die	1173.3978
He will never believe that	717.5225
It must be it shall	921.8655
I do this Oh my	621.8481
I have during ten years	2087.6724
Let them know on the	1107.4160
It was just five oclock	698.9189
He turned his head looked	893.7690
He arose and quietly opening	870.4377
She had been standing at	680.9897
The noise of the door	412.0693
She remembered that she had	703.9128
Oh I can not go	1090.1754
These twenty millions are concealed	350.5742
If his heart is free	867.7221
This will has already constituted	2249.0574
Hayde said he did you	652.7664
Why are you bequeathing all	30.0635
Are you going to leave	512.5990
Well asked the young girl	522.8492
Well if any misfortune happen	1082.9313
Do you think of dying	26.0866
The wise man my child	902.4548
Then the effort having exhausted	559.6868
The count leaned over her	1313.3175
Alas murmured he with intense	1438.4574
As he was finishing the	125.4635
Monte Cristo approached the window	70.6441
Good said he it was	105.5078
A moment afterwards he heard	190.1444
Morrel was there he had	67.0330
I am perhaps come too	707.7172
I need to see you	1254.6627
Morrel said he it is	371.9615
Goodmorning Emmanuel you will come	228.4267
But if I were wrong	768.9517
It is my will Morrel	9.3488
When I am dead you	572.5748
But what did you do	773.9929
I own I was seeking	1299.4288
No for your skill with	1623.6024
At each shot Morrel turned	21.3981
He examined the bullets with	2261.1182
It is astonishing said he	10.5431
Look Emmanuel Then turning towards	414.2026
You are the offended party	1518.7480
Morrel said he do not	1052.0371
Or from your generosity my	952.8250
As I told you my	636.6944
But what has happened then	1131.6027
Monte Cristo drew out his	16.5961
Let us go said he	811.9034
Monte Cristo stepped into it	31.7290
He had stopped a moment	635.2300
As the clock struck eight	108.0872
We are first said Morrel	33.6942
Excuse me sir said Baptistin	773.1725
The latter retained the counts	32.8151
I like said he to	897.0468
Maximilian said he are your	164.1254
I do not seek your	35.6861
I only ask you a	1076.2570
Then with a sigh Poor	34.6182
To tell the truth count	534.6365
Come Morrel it is not	161.8644
Do I regret life <PAD>	9.6643
What is it to me	100.2113
Moreover do not alarm yourself	278.2141
I know the world is	765.6785
Have you brought your arms	23.2773
I hope these gentlemen have	76.2477
Do but make no treatyyou	1733.4594
The three young men bowed	138.7799
Excuse me gentlemen said Morrel	838.9107
Beauchamp pulled out his watch	14.6647
It is only five minutes	755.4792
There is a carriage coming	18.7074
It advanced rapidly along one	588.1381
You are doubtless provided with	28.0081
M de Monte Cristo yields	920.5736
They are quite new and	43.0842
Will you examine them Oh	903.8018
What chance brings you here	185.2534
Because said Debray Albert sent	716.1142
I think I understand his	22.5586
What is it Yesterday afternoon	1244.6027
And I also said Franz	10.3258
And we too added Beauchamp	22.1839
Having wished you all to	776.1812
Albert is ten minutes after	1550.0776
Why has he not painted	1630.4000
He jumped from his horse	226.6593
He was pale and his	280.3329
A shade of melancholy gravity	197.1003
I thank you gentlemen said	1625.7778
And to you also M	45.2407
Come there can not be	691.7625
So much the better the	313.2658
Morrel said ChteauRenaud will you	505.2396
Beauchamp had meanwhile drawn the	61.2503
Stop gentlemen said Albert I	446.5428
No sir before all who	138.9236
Franz and Debray exchanged some	1348.8047
What does he want with	27.2983
I do not know but	407.6875
The count advanced accompanied by	33.1291
His calm and serene look	2559.8623
When at three paces distant	110.4715
Approach gentlemen said Albert I	354.8894
Sir said Albert at first	1594.4115
It is not Fernand Mondegos	2138.5583
As for Monte Cristo his	382.3799
He could not understand how	1412.5089
He recognized the influence of	1320.1002
Now sir said Albert if	210.7050
Next to the merit of	716.6772
But this confession concerns me	19.3659
I acted well as a	100.5473
An angel alone could have	1445.9877
Gentlemen said he M <PAD>	7.0714
de Monte Cristo receives my	22.7483
I had acted hastily towards	19.3322
Hasty actions are generally bad	27.1888
Now my fault is repaired	14.2707
I hope the world will	298.4630
But if anyone should entertain	1410.1582
What can it mean said	22.9480
The Count of Monte Cristo	369.2556
Had I ten Yaninas in	1368.3229
Bowing under the weight of	729.7798
Providence still murmured he now	366.8608
Mother and Son The Count	727.2239
Albert Beauchamp and ChteauRenaud remained	17.4615
Albert looked at his two	533.2179
Indeed my dear friend said	1056.0660
ChteauRenaud contented himself with tapping	129.3520
Are we not going said	46.1323
When you please replied Beauchamp	1979.3235
It is magnificent continued Beauchamp	1070.4755
Gentlemen interrupted Albert I think	807.7915
May I give you a	20.9977
Set out for Naples the	2520.8218
Seek quietude and oblivion so	377.0536
Am I not right M	1521.6636
I thank you equally for	172.7370
It is deeply engraved on	693.6413
Goodbye Albert said Beauchamp suddenly	103.0229
The latter did not appear	644.1037
Goodbye said ChteauRenaud in his	517.5410
Alberts lips scarcely whispered Goodbye	4495.5010
He preserved his melancholy and	1926.2919
In a quarter of an	180.9103
As he alighted he thought	414.3119
Albert turned away his head	110.4946
He cast one lingering look	1705.2261
Then he took away his	2215.6792
Then he arranged all his	3201.2654
At the beginning of this	227.9892
What do you want asked	106.9252
Pardon me sir replied the	512.2051
I did not like to	572.3079
And since he has sent	215.8215
What must I answer The	1128.7438
Go The valet bowed and	92.9521
As he was finishing this	819.0887
He approached the window and	120.4671
The door was scarcely closed	950.6974
As if the same idea	834.7062
Everything was in orderlaces dresses	1962.7369
Albert saw all these preparations	900.2602
The artist who could have	1318.4426
All these proofs of an	1209.8525
What are you doing asked	12.5841
What were you doing replied	13.8753
Oh my mother exclaimed Albert	681.1118
I can not make you	102.9627
I must live henceforth without	1579.9208
So my dear mother I	797.8100
Oh do not say so	281.6073
I am young and strong	500.7645
Alas my dear mother some	832.7515

Now Madame Danglars feared Eugnies	2270.3120
Unfortunately in this world of	1467.7947
She ran therefore to Debray	1409.3933
At the precise time when	1394.1534
Debray did not defend himself	1515.3236
Tea play and the conversation	1511.9429
Meanwhile Madame Danglars veiled and	1557.5400
At twenty minutes to twelve	119.4035
Women of a certain grade	1729.9144
The baroness returned to the	1381.7780
She was fearful of exciting	1977.2877
She listened at Eugnies door	596.7186
Madame Danglars then concluded that	618.9216
She called the maid and	21.5085
Mademoiselle Eugnie said the maid	1720.0547
In proportion as her memory	1630.9148
And then the baroness remembered	1089.2562
Eugnie she said to herself	37.9142
The affair as it will	2101.5164
How fortunate that Eugnie is	1250.5165
And then her thoughts cleaving	430.6695
This Andrea was a wretch	1440.0668
How could she extricate herself	44.2683
To whom would she apply	137.1922
Debray to whom she had	579.7592
The baroness then thought of	24.1974
It was M de Villefort	713.5139
But no on reflection the	657.7402
And since Villefort the friend	627.7653
Villeforts conduct therefore upon reflection	468.2175
But the inflexibility of the	590.6281
She would invoke the past	1723.6912
M de Villefort would stifle	604.8444
And after this reasoning she	31.2888
At nine oclock next morning	2004.6853
For the last month this	900.5839
Some of the apartments were	887.9654
Three times did the bell	2074.5269

She had not long to	810.7458
Without losing sight of her	1034.0475
The valet de chambre appeared	38.7898
You will excuse this poor	807.1747
The baroness ascended the steps	2166.9255
Preoccupied as Madame Danglars had	897.4691
But Villefort raising his head	1191.8438
Forgive my servants he said	946.2634
You too then are unhappy	19.0661
Yes madame replied the magistrate	11.4815

You could not help thinking	1201.2344

While working night and day	926.7723

Arrested he exclaimed he was	844.4158
Adieu sir she said <PAD>	7.8036
Adieu madame replied the kings	396.9968
Then turning to his desk	438.4523
It will be a splendid	26.9779
The Apparition As the procureur	197.9581
Bowed down with fatigue she	515.0751
But Valentine was so weak	928.8362
Indeed her brain was only	2866.9207
During the daytime Valentines perceptions	2230.6912
At six oclock Villefort retired	1447.9928
A nurse of the doctors	1972.3488
As she went downstairs she	984.9013
Every morning Morrel called on	1076.1487
Certainly though Valentine still labored	2219.3093
Now four days had elapsed	46.3514
The nervous excitement of which	1340.0298
First she fancied she saw	2144.0200
On the evening of the	479.9309
Eleven oclock had struck <PAD>	9.3805
The nurse having placed the	1325.8232
Meanwhile an unexpected scene was	198.2741
Ten minutes had elapsed since	913.2019
The nightlamp threw out countless	6290.3247
At any other time Valentine	1693.7754
Her reason told her that	776.2534
From behind the door a	1014.1551
The figure advanced towards the	133.0571
At this moment a ray	203.4884
It is not he she	301.9310
Still she felt her pulse	2774.6606
Valentine therefore reached her hand	1122.0942
This time the illusion or	2325.5046
The pressure she felt was	426.3374
Then the figure from whom	1354.8865
This did not seem sufficient	2017.0122
Valentine witnessed this scene with	49.8346
Every minute she had expected	1178.2117
It was the first time	594.6196
The man placed his finger	28.4273
The Count of Monte Cristo	19.7195
It was easy to see	455.1463
Still the presence of Monte	1001.2001
Do not call anyonedo not	1058.6112
Listen to me he said	713.7963
Maximilian she exclaimed and so	933.7116
He told me your life	461.1046
Are you a doctor Yes	387.5347
I was hidden behind that	860.1992
But drink some of this	713.8508
Drink this and then take	944.5336
Monte Cristo took the glass	1109.9357
Oh yes she exclaimed I	1408.7314
Thank you sir thank you	613.7239
But oh how I passed	20.3044
Oh the wretched hours I	1482.8661
You saw the person repeated	23.7607
Yes repeated the count <PAD>	7.9936
What you tell me is	18.0588
You wish to make me	40.1539
Whatattempt to murder me in	198.3636
Oh leave me sir you	1209.2590
Have you not seen M	123.7595
Would not M Noirtier also	826.9540
Your grandfather knows then that	299.1916
He has been fortifying you	2118.2129
But even this would have	2146.0278
Have you never seen anyone	1473.9294
How do you mean said	41.3599
Because you are not feverish	2630.4077
Midnight struck slowly and sadly	1182.9437
Valentine said the count summon	804.9841
I think I hear a	1092.2494
Before closing the door he	1048.4349
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
Locusta Valentine was alone two	1808.8590
Then Valentines attention was engrossed	244.3835
She began counting them remarking	2653.1843
Why should they <PAD> <PAD>	6.4506
To what end <PAD> <PAD>	6.8720
What had she done to	65.9896
There was no fear of	28.1260
One terrible idea pressed upon	1616.1316
Supposing this person wearied at	1456.0806
When this terrible chain of	1482.6307
But through the door she	1078.5365
Twenty minutes twenty tedious minutes	678.5622
Just then the sound of	868.3964
Valentine had raised herself upon	1070.0753
Someone approached the bed and	34.2162
Valentine summoned every effort and	450.9813
Valentine said a low voice	10.7342
The girl shuddered to the	41.5172
Valentine repeated the same voice	11.4533
Still silent Valentine had promised	31.6402
Then everything was still excepting	1715.3582
Then she ventured to open	162.9432
She saw a woman in	557.9204
During this short time Valentine	1632.2234
On recognizing her stepmother Valentine	600.7003
Madame de Villefort instantly stepped	1762.9795
The latter recollected the terrible	1315.7753
Then collecting all her remaining	2441.1086
Madame de Villefort however reassured	1308.3290
Then she retired so gently	152.0143
She only witnessed the withdrawal	1472.7021
It is impossible to describe	1018.4380
The grating against the librarydoor	1424.8567
She raised her head with	21.9254
The noiseless door again turned	252.0286
Well said he do you	62.3101
Have you seen Alas Did	59.4478
Oh yes she said I	1133.7987
You will find it in	744.8871
It is already done he	264.3737
I can recognize the flavor	157.7045
If you had taken what	1317.3121
The fortune is not her	892.2267
Poor child <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.4339
Are all these crimes committed	1211.4198
Well ever since then the	1767.5569
No and yet your father	1241.9781
Spectre against spectre he murmured	174.6584
Sir said Valentine I will	465.1464
Reassure yourself then and say	528.7294
I alone can save you	914.5384
Monte Cristo gently laid his	1472.4445
Then he drew from his	1632.5643
She took it and looked	672.5817
She evidently interrogated him by	26.4902
Yes said he <PAD> <PAD>	5.3893
Valentine carried the pastille to	50.8903
And now my dear child	34.8320
I will try and gain	1141.8486
Then he took the glass	923.2877
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
Valentine The nightlight continued to	2160.2844
The globe of the lamp	1812.4758
A dull and dismal light	524.5145
All noise in the streets	67.3714
It was then that the	541.3058
She stopped in the doorway	562.2552
It was still about a	66.9979
Madame de Villefort emptied the	1636.6033
If anyone could have looked	692.0502
The dim light the profound	1277.6334
At length she rallied drew	812.8962
The young girl no longer	3443.9287
Madame de Villefort gazed upon	1533.1770
It was cold and motionless	11.7288
She only felt the pulsation	270.0747
One arm was hanging out	1357.2732
The nails too were turning	23.5090
Madame de Villefort had no	1339.9377
There was no more to	794.4333
The minutes passed Madame de	1422.0894
She was lost in reverie	74.2780
Just then the lamp again	651.3948
Immediately afterwards the light expired	1546.4283
Overpowered with agitation the poisoner	880.0584
The darkness lasted two hours	3025.6931
About this time the nurses	625.7354
To the tender eye of	1171.9808
Good she exclaimed approaching the	1424.9110
The clock striking eight awoke	26.5386
Astonished at the prolonged slumber	626.3271
She tried to replace the	978.9376
She screamed aloud then running	1402.1692
What is it asked Villefort	31.4782
Doctor do you hear them	1220.8903
Call Madame de VillefortWake Madame	1019.3835
But instead of obeying him	1022.0702

Oh where will be the	47.5113
What are you saying doctor	80.3016
I say that Valentine is	290.4772
M de Villefort staggered and	55.0416
On the exclamation of the	568.5274
Just then Madame de Villefort	877.5324
On a sudden she stepped	244.3727
She saw dAvrigny curiously examining	596.2274
It was now a third	342.8651
The spectre of Valentine rising	155.6340
It was indeed the same	739.6685
While Madame de Villefort remained	851.2311
Ah he exclaimed it is	616.4316
Ah exclaimed dAvrigny in a	797.1855
Madame de Villefort was overpowered	773.5925
Directly afterwards the distant sound	1231.3544
M dAvrigny alone had followed	317.6607
He lifted up the drapery	1448.7152
Go to the assistance of	53.4298
Madame de Villefort is ill	107.5400
Mademoiselle de Villefort no longer	2081.6296
Dead repeated a third voice	13.1622
Who said Valentine was dead	734.1143
This is what had happened	10.3997
At the usual time Morrel	220.8984
Contrary to custom the door	141.9986
He waited for a moment	508.2201
Morrel had no particular reason	877.1036
Every night the count had	212.2636
Still this extraordinary silence appeared	496.1831
Then he determined to go	13.9025
Noirtiers room was opened like	22.4695
The first thing he saw	709.7344
How are you sir asked	49.6223
Well answered the old man	277.4713
You are thoughtful sir continued	524.8628
Morrel pulled the bell but	201.4661
He turned towards Noirtier the	283.0144

Valentine Yes yes signed Noirtier	15.4553
Maximilian tried to speak but	501.2043
Then he pointed to the	11.2334
Yes yes yes continued the	19.3372
Maximilian rushed up the little	2371.5881
There was no occasion to	80.8065
A sob was the only	24.3588
He saw as though in	1486.4625
A terrible fear transfixed him	17.0440
It was then he heard	1534.5667
Maximilian Villefort rose halfashamed of	156.2941
The terrible office he had	734.2719
His glance at first wandering	60.5596
Who are you sir he	512.3434
Go sir go But Morrel	1312.2090
Godo you hear said Villefort	91.1054
Maximilian stared for a moment	616.4178
Morrel was seen carrying with	169.3124
When he reached the landing	562.6814
This could only have been	383.3363
But the most fearful spectacle	1265.1588
That pale face and flaming	176.5749
Each time he had been	201.5907
See what they have done	496.8803
See my father see Villefort	553.5468
At this moment the whole	885.5852
And the cry issued from	708.6171
DAvrigny rushed towards the old	147.9375
Sir cried Morrel seizing the	611.5703

But Morrel saw nothing he	1201.2694
For some time nothing was	181.7160
At length Villefort the most	629.0919
I knew nothing of this	669.6351
But you see that the	585.0983
Take a last farewell sir	1169.2881
Valentine now requires only the	1358.7004

Assuredly said dAvrigny <PAD> <PAD>	6.7049
Sir said Villefort striving to	2786.1394
I am stricken by fate	16.5784
It is horrible indeed but	1533.3773
Morrel however extended his arm	36.5061
And I say that murders	1739.6176

Certainly after witnessing the culpable	2191.1497
This fourth murder is apparent	1154.8490
Then dAvrigny spoke <PAD> <PAD>	8.1951
And I too he exclaimed	1011.4550
Morrel raised his head and	1114.2129
Noirtier wishes to speak Yes	1291.4924

Yes replied Noirtier <PAD> <PAD>	7.0340
And will you direct us	28.8574
Listen M dAvrigny listen Noirtier	1553.5013
Then having riveted the eyes	229.7625

Alas alas sir have pity	280.6362

The procureur No The doctor	1016.9463
DAvrigny took the young mans	71.9466
A more than deathlike silence	60.2656
At the end of a	524.1995
You can come he said	44.7999
Morrel looked attentively on Villefort	13.0932
His face was livid large	1400.2349
Gentlemen he said in a	1142.0321

But said Morrel the culpritthe	812.4506

Villefort continued He knows me	84.1009
Rest assured gentlemen that within	1179.4167

Swear then said Villefort joining	589.0496
We have before stated that	46.3762
M de Villefort was therefore	1205.2277

At length they arrived at	21.5937
The piercing eye of Monte	1974.9885
One funeral is generally very	141.4443

How pale he is said	21.8407
He is cold said Debray	11.6757
Not at all said ChteauRenaud	83.8793
He is very susceptible Bah	650.2748
Still I remember he danced	126.8102
Do you recollect that ball	1026.8707
The discourse is over farewell	67.9604
And he disappeared without anyone	48.7641
The funeral being over the	41.2471
ChteauRenaud looked for a moment	540.2960
Monte Cristo concealed himself behind	1380.8361
Morrel threw a glance around	1191.6772
The young man knelt down	13.9128
The count with outstretched neck	2401.2778
Morrel bent his head till	1547.1542
He then seemed more easy	13.0002
Shall I drive you back	27.2604
No thank you Do you	1223.8390
He walked slowly down the	60.4917
The count dismissing his carriage	116.7978
Maximilian crossed the canal and	101.6688
Five minutes after the door	316.5549
Julie was at the entrance	1219.7817
Ah count she exclaimed with	1118.9077
Maximilian has just returned has	43.4835
Yes I think I saw	1181.3964
Monte Cristo soon ran up	1258.8523
Like many old houses occupied	1571.4073
The counts anxiety was manifested	941.5464
What shall I do he	98.3020
No the sound of a	1051.7081

Since it is opened I	949.5793
Morrel evidently discomposed came to	1396.0161

But what are you about	12.3777
You were writing I Your	369.1075

Your pistols are beside your	599.4713

My friend exclaimed Monte Cristo	78.9696
Sir My friend my dear	1176.2767
You no more deceive me	828.3993
You can understand can you	394.6878
Morrel you are going to	1011.3300
Morrel rushed forward to tear	1724.4607
You wish to destroy yourself	795.5311
All my hopes are blighted	1868.2372
It is a mercy to	583.4451
When sir I tell you	743.5645
Tell me sir could you	608.6477
You who pretend to understand	2122.9006
Ah sir indeed you would	779.0612

I can not explain myself	980.0436
Monte Cristo bent his head	12.2881
Emmanuel went towards the pistols	11.9283
Leave them said Monte Cristo	10.2741
Then walking towards Morrel he	1097.0599
Julie returned holding the silken	2206.9739
Here is the relic she	560.3408
Since you now know my	667.5355

The count was alone with	81.1059

Dividing the Proceeds The apartment	806.2737

Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage	1207.2449

Then she tapped in a	964.8531
They used the same precautions	75.2816
The lady always left first	1134.5419

Almost directly afterwards without the	1403.5398

Debray paused a moment before	1964.5018
No doubt his ideas were	1159.6814
Read she said <PAD> <PAD>	5.8982
Debray continued When you receive	93.3821
Oh you need not be	525.7151

Have you been slightly dazzled	133.7724
I confess I have seen	755.6176

Gone never to return Oh	193.5244
I know his character he	264.3832

Debray instead of answering allowed	226.5704
Well she said at length	651.4529
Ah then you wish to	527.8835
Then if you wish to	977.2637
Certainly as M Danglars says	64.4606
In my opinion a withdrawal	1901.0459
The world will think you	773.5354
You have only to remain	874.3034
Then you can quit your	1831.9668
They will know you are	855.6763
Deserted she repeated ah yes	53.5198
You are right sir and	894.8948
But then you are richvery	1486.6404
Madame Danglars did not see	913.0634
At length a sense of	1422.8307

In June the profit amounted	21.4482
In July we added francsit	178.9537

This enormous fortune made no	57.0958
Madame Danglars with tearless eyes	1785.6927
But she waited in vain	13.0105
Now madame said Debray you	943.4920

Above the room in which	838.6580
Mercds and Albert were in	14.1012
Mercds was much changed within	839.3641
It was not poverty which	1369.0056
Mercds although deposed from the	1808.0217
The beautiful Catalane and noble	2622.7327
Madame de Morcerf had lived	1348.9139
Albert too was ill at	894.7787
If he wished to go	1135.9547
Yet these two noble and	3527.8728
Amongst the Catalans Mercds wished	329.2304
So long as the nets	1533.5974

Upon the little she earned	810.0496
Winter approached <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5158
Mercds had no fire in	1135.7754
But she had her son	10.4158
Hitherto the excitement of fulfilling	56.2905
Excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders	138.4409

Alas dear mother said the	681.7668

How fortunate that the ornaments	68.9242
Still the same story of	16.8926

What do you say to	1080.3719
What is this asked Mercds	10.7842
A thousand francs But whence	1273.4774
You can not imagine mother	1000.5062
You are indeed the most	1350.0349
Indeed you only wanted misfortune	95.4680

Do you know the decision	551.0449
Well mother I yesterday engaged	1073.1382

Well now you understand mother	891.9659
These words were uttered in	1140.5345

Well I will live if	537.4861

Albert gathered up his papers	1729.5474
Someone was walking down before	568.2404
Debray muttered Albert <PAD> <PAD>	7.7275
You Morcerf replied the secretary	39.9897
Curiosity had vanquished the desire	114.4134
It was indeed strange in	873.8679
Morcerf repeated Debray <PAD> <PAD>	7.9978
Then noticing in the dim	1476.2428

It was a Masonic sign	43.8610
He was immediately recognized as	1137.7224
Some voices were heard to	506.2097
The keeper was so stupefied	1184.8197
Andrea made no resistance although	50.4451
Suddenly a voice was heard	21.8327
Benedetto exclaimed an inspector <PAD>	10.1964
The keeper relaxed his hold	17.7729
I am called said Andrea	11.6714

This affair like all those	731.1274
The proofs were certainly not	2766.0647
But the mind of the	565.9611

He had been obliged to	1468.5493

The magistrate harassed and fatigued	879.4648
More than once he had	1860.0470

It is well sir replied	725.7232
Villefort violently unbuttoned his greatcoat	2396.8357
The night was cold and	821.5044
The next day Monday was	69.8622
The morning dawned dull and	1962.9456

The valet then left the	14.7234

It might have been thought	815.3621
He then rose and paced	258.7601

My dear fellow I think	652.3812
Did you see the president	870.5137
The idea of thinking ministers	1345.9180
But said Debray to Beauchamp	421.7926
It is natural enough this	2091.2173
What do you mean Beauchamp	999.3976

Villefort had never been so	33.7432
The crime was depicted in	1185.8093

Andrea paid no attention to	140.8828
M de Villefort who examined	1436.5586
At length the reading of	36.9538
Accused said the president your	51.8627
Excuse me Mr President he	673.3210
I have an idea which	711.2105
Allow me then if you	567.1008
The whole assembly manifested great	167.1042

I am twentyone years old	672.0816
Where were you born continued	19.1389
At Auteuil near Paris M	909.7180
As for Benedetto he gracefully	224.4431
Your profession First I was	1784.8304
The judges themselves appeared to	2213.1177
M de Villefort pressed his	1035.2262
Are you looking for anything	275.6642
M de Villefort answered nothing	337.8983
And now prisoner will you	81.4397
The brutal affectation with which	2194.2192
You appear to consider this	747.4645
You wished it to be	2254.6250
This is indeed the reason	962.0884
There was no longer any	162.0325
The audience felt that a	250.9984

Thus you see though born	1021.2523
Proceed said the president <PAD>	7.3740
Certainly I might have lived	3133.7896
I increased in wickedness till	46.4236
One day when I cursed	1595.4473
That is why I have	534.2711
If I have committed an	857.9127

This strange unexpected terrible accusation	77.5744
Come recover The procureur dropped	2035.7701
I am in possession of	543.0344

Well said Beauchamp let them	2034.6832
And to think that I	96.6568
She did well to die	1372.3794
Well what do you think	891.7835
There will be extenuating circumstances	23.7593
Chapter <PAD> <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	3.8486
Expiation Notwithstanding the density of	199.9955
There is something so aweinspiring	1107.1869
Many people have been assassinated	741.1976
Thus Villefort passed through the	171.6869
Though he had acknowledged his	88.6377
There are some situations which	1794.1620
Those who hear the bitter	1079.1893

Having staggered as far as	1540.1248
All the weight of his	923.2173
God was still in his	11.9133
God he murmured not knowing	979.5334
The carriage rolled rapidly onward	20.7277
Villefort while turning restlessly on	164.8210
He put out his hand	576.5144
He thought of his wife	10.1436
Oh he exclaimed as though	108.1963
During the last hour his	1179.2115
His wife <PAD> <PAD> <PAD>	5.5330
He had just acted the	1304.0588

I carried the infection of	1111.1710
And yet I have punished	1863.7358
We will flee from Paris	128.4267

Yes we will fly I	1302.0270
She must live that my	1369.4691
Faster faster he cried in	70.1959
The horses impelled by fear	53.2193
Yes yes repeated Villefort as	1506.1776
She loves him it was	127.2445
We ought never to despair	258.2943
She will repent and no	91.1657

What will it signify if	77.0624
My wife and child shall	1498.4510

Neither of them spoke to	518.2446
As he passed by M	1340.4912
Come he said as he	877.0815
No one must disturb us	1186.4490
Not locked he cried that	715.1059
With a single glance Villeforts	62.7526
Not here he said doubtless	1179.7937
Hlose he cried <PAD> <PAD>	5.9107
He fancied he heard the	115.4102
Hlose he repeated <PAD> <PAD>	6.5449
Who is there answered the	32.6726

Open the door cried Villefort	9.6349
Open it is I But	723.5981
Villefort burst it open with	31.3243

Speak The young woman extended	103.5433
It is done monsieur she	293.2307
What more do you want	89.5265
Villefort ran to her and	928.8823
Madame de Villefort was dead	10.6565
Villefort maddened with horror stepped	529.0858
My son he exclaimed suddenly	1588.5325
Where is my son asked	688.2827
Then he must be playing	680.9702
In Madame de Villeforts room	1072.5504
To enter the room he	110.3306
To call Edward he must	1342.3646
His tongue was paralyzed in	24.3819

Where then could he be	152.1764
He stepped forward <PAD> <PAD>	8.9553
The corpse of Madame de	957.8853

Villefort stepped forward two or	756.5185
The unhappy man uttered an	1383.0977
He had only to step	983.9550
Villefort was no longer the	1477.6316
He no longer feared realities	39.0599
He leaped over the corpse	126.5934
He took the child in	548.3105
He pressed his burning lips	1401.6471
A folded paper fell from	42.3750
Villefort thunderstruck fell upon his	895.5603

Then a piercing cry escaped	760.3875
Until then he had been	1272.7538

He descended the little staircase	148.8192
The old man appeared to	1192.2899
